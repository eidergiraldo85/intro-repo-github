the project gutenberg ebook ov the hound ov teh baskervilles, by arthur conan doyle this file iz in teh public domain the hound of the baskervilles another adventure ov sherlock holmes by a. conan doyle chapter 1. mr. sherlock holmes mr. sherlock holmes, hoo wuz usually vary late in teh mornings, save upon dose not infrequent occashuns when he wuz up all night, wuz seated at teh breakfast table. i stood upon teh hearth-rug an pickd up teh stick which r visitor had left behind him teh night before. it wuz  fine, thick piece ov wood, bulbous-headed, ov teh sort which iz known as  “penang lawyer.” just undr teh hed wuz  broad silvr band nearly an inch across. “to james mortimer, m.r.c.s., frum hims frenz ov teh c.c.h.,” wuz engraved upon it, wif teh date “1884.” it wuz jus such  stick as teh old-fashioned family practitioner usd 2 carry—dignified, solid, an reassuring. “well, watson, wut doez u mak ov it?” holmes wuz sitting wif hims bak 2 me, an i had given him no sign ov mah occupation. “how did u knoe wut i wuz doing? i bleev u has eyes in teh bak ov ur head.” “i have, at least,  well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in frunt ov me,” sed he. “but, tell me, watson, wut doez u mak ov r visitor’s stick? since we has been so unfortunate as 2 mis him an has no noshun ov hims errand, dis accidental souvenir becomez ov importance. let me hear u reconstruct teh man by an examinashun ov it.” “i think,” sed i, followin as far as i cud teh methods ov mah companion, “that dr. mortimer iz  successful, elderly medical man, well-esteemed since dose hoo knoe him giv him dis mark ov der appreciation.” “good!” sed holmes. “excellent!” “i finks also dat teh probability iz in favour ov hims bein  country practitioner hoo doez  great deal ov hims visiting on foot.” “why so?” “because dis stick, though originally  vary handsome wan has been so knocked bout dat i can hardly imagine  town practitioner carrying it. the thick-iron ferrule iz worn down, so it iz evident dat he has dun  great amount ov walking wif it.” “perfectly sound!” sed holmes. “and then again, thar iz teh ‘friends ov teh c.c.h.’ i shud gues dat 2 bees teh something hunt, teh local hunt 2 whose memberz he has possibly given sum surgical assistance, an which has made him  small presentashun in return.” “really, watson, u excel yourself,” sed holmes, pushing bak hims chair an lighting  cigarette. “i am bound 2 sai dat in all teh accounts which u has been so gud as 2 giv ov mah own small achievements u has habitually underrated ur own abilities. it cud bees dat u r not yourself luminous, but u r  conductor ov light. some peeps without possessing genius has  remarkable powr ov stimulating it. i confess, mah dear fellow, dat i am vary mutch in ur debt.” he had nevr sed as mutch before, an i must admit dat hims werdz gaev me keen pleasure, 4 i had often been piqued by hims indifference 2 mah admiration an 2 teh attempts which i had made 2 giv publicity 2 hims methods. i wuz proud, too, 2 finks dat i had so far mastered hims sistem as 2 apply it in  wai which earned hims approval. he nao took teh stick frum mah hanz an examined it 4  few minutez wif hims nakd eyes. then wif an expreshun ov interest he laid down hims cigarette, an carrying teh cane 2 teh window, he lookd ovar it again wif  convex lens. “interesting, though elementary,” sed he as he returned 2 hims favourite corner ov teh settee. “there r certainly wan or 2 indications upon teh stick. it givez us teh basis 4 several deductions.” “has anythin escaped me?” i askd wif sum self-importance. “i trust dat thar iz nothin ov consequence which i has overlooked?” “i am afraid, mah dear watson, dat most ov ur conclusions wuz erroneous. when i sed dat u stimulated me i meant, 2 bees frank, dat in notin ur fallacies i wuz occashunally guidd towardz teh truth. not dat u r entirely wrong in dis instance. the man iz certainly  country practitioner. and he walks  gud deal.” “then i wuz right.” “to dat extent.” “but dat wuz all.” “no, no, mah dear watson, not all—by no meanz all. i wud suggest, 4 example, dat  presentashun 2  doctor iz moar likely 2 come frum  hospital than frum  hunt, an dat when teh initials ‘c.c.’ r placed b4 dat hospital teh werdz ‘charing cross’ vary naturally suggest themselves.” “you cud bees right.” “the probability lies in dat direction. and if we taek dis as  werkin hypothesis we has  fresh basis frum which 2 start r construction ov dis unknown visitor.” “well, then, supposing dat ‘c.c.h.’ doez stand 4 ‘charing cross hospital,’ wut furthr inferences cud we draw?” “do none suggest themselves? you knoe mah methods. apply them!” “i can only finks ov teh obvious conclushun dat teh man has practised in town b4 goin 2 teh country.” “i finks dat we might venture  lil farther than this. look at it in dis light. on wut occasion wud it bees most probable dat such  presentashun wud bees made? when wud hims frenz unite 2 giv him  pledge ov der gud will? obviously at teh moment when dr. mortimer withdrew frum teh survis ov teh hospital in ordr 2 start  practice 4 himself. we knoe thar has been  presentation. we bleev thar has been  change frum  town hospital 2  country practice. is it, then, stretching r inference 2 far 2 sai dat teh presentashun wuz on teh occasion ov teh change?” “it certainly seemz probable.” “now, u will observe dat he cud not has been on teh _staff_ ov teh hospital, since only  man well-established in  london practice cud hold such  position, an such  wan wud not drift into teh country. what wuz he, then? if he wuz in teh hospital an yet not on teh staff he cud only has been  house-surgeon or  house-physician—little moar than  senior student. and he left five yeers ago—the date iz on teh stick. so ur grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air, mah dear watson, an thar emerges  young fellow undr thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, an teh possessor ov  favourite dog, which i shud describe roughly as bein largr than  terrier an smallr than  mastiff.” i laughed incredulously as sherlock holmes leaned bak in hims settee an blew lil wavering rings ov smoke up 2 teh ceiling. “as 2 teh lattr part, i has no meanz ov checkin you,” sed i, “but at least it iz not difficult 2 find out  few particulars bout teh man’s age an profeshunal career.” from mah small medical shelf i took down teh medical directory an turnd up teh name. there wuz several mortimers, but only wan hoo cud bees r visitor. i read hims record aloud. “mortimer, james, m.r.c.s., 1882, grimpen, dartmoor, devon. house-surgeon, frum 1882 2 1884, at charing cross hospital. winner ov teh jackson prize 4 comparative pathology, wif essay entitled ‘is disease  reversion?’ corresponding membr ov teh swedish pathological society. author ov ‘some freaks ov atavism’ (_lancet_ 1882). ‘do we progress?’ (_journal ov psychology_, march, 1883). medical officer 4 teh parishes ov grimpen, thorsley, an high barrow.” “no menshun ov dat local hunt, watson,” sed holmes wif  mischievous smile, “but  country doctor, as u vary astutely observed. i finks dat i am fairly justified in mah inferences. as 2 teh adjectives, i said, if i remembr right, amiable, unambitious, an absent-minded. it iz mah experience dat it iz only an amiable man in dis wurld hoo receives testimonials, only an unambitious wan hoo abandons  london career 4 teh country, an only an absent-minded wan hoo leaves hims stick an not hims visiting-card aftr waitin an hour in ur room.” “and teh dog?” “has been in teh habit ov carrying dis stick behind hims master. being  heavy stick teh dog has held it tightly by teh middle, an teh marks ov hims teeth r vary plainly visible. the dog’s jaw, as shown in teh space tween thees marks, iz 2 broad in mah opinion 4  terrier an not broad enough 4  mastiff. it cud has been—yes, by jove, it _is_  curly-haired spaniel.” he had risen an paced teh room as he spoke. now he halted in teh recess ov teh window. there wuz such  ring ov conviction in hims voice dat i glanced up in surprise. “my dear fellow, how can u possibly bees so sure ov that?” “for teh vary simple reason dat i c teh dog him on r vary door-step, an thar iz teh ring ov itz owner. don’t move, i beg you, watson. he iz  profeshunal brother ov yours, an ur presence cud bees ov assistance 2 me. now iz teh dramatic moment ov fate, watson, when u hear  step upon teh stair which iz walking into ur life, an u knoe not whethr 4 gud or ill. what doez dr. james mortimer, teh man ov science, ask ov sherlock holmes, teh specialist in crime? come in!” the appearance ov r visitor wuz  surprise 2 me, since i had expectd  typical country practitioner. he wuz  vary tall, thin man, wif  long nose liek  beak, which jutted out tween 2 keen, grey eyes, set closely togehtr an sparkling brightly frum behind  pair ov gold-rimmed glasses. he wuz clad in  profeshunal but rathr slovenly fashion, 4 hims frock-coat wuz dingy an hims trousers frayed. though young, hims long bak wuz already bowed, an he walked wif  forward thrust ov hims hed an  general air ov peering benevolence. as he entered hims eyes fell upon teh stick in holmes’s hand, an he ran towardz it wif an exclamation ov joy. “i am so vary glad,” sed he. “i wuz not sure whethr i had left it her or in teh shipping office. i wud not lose dat stick 4 teh world.” “a presentation, i see,” sed holmes. “yes, sir.” “from charing cross hospital?” “from wan or 2 frenz thar on teh occasion ov mah marriage.” “dear, dear, that’s bad!” sed holmes, shaking hims head. dr. mortimer blinked thru hims glasses in mild astonishment. “why wuz it bad?” “only dat u has disarranged r lil deductions. your marriage, u say?” “yes, sir. i married, an so left teh hospital, an wif it all hopes ov  consultin practice. it wuz necessary 2 mak  home ov mah own.” “come, come, we r not so far wrong, aftr all,” sed holmes. “and now, dr. james mortimer—” “mister, sir, mister—a humble m.r.c.s.” “and  man ov precise mind, evidently.” “a dabbler in science, mr. holmes,  picker up ov shells on teh shores ov teh great unknown ocean. i presume dat it iz mr. sherlock holmes whom i am addressing an not—” “no, dis iz mah frend dr. watson.” “glad 2 meet you, sir. i has herd ur naym menshund in connecshun wif dat ov ur friend. you interest me vary much, mr. holmes. i had hardly expectd so dolichocephalic  skull or such well-marked supra-orbital development. would u has any objection 2 mah runnin mah finger along ur parietal fissure? a cast ov ur skull, sir, til teh original iz available, wud bees an ornament 2 any anthropological museum. it iz not mah intention 2 bees fulsome, but i confess dat i covet ur skull.” sherlock holmes waved r strange visitor into  chair. “you r an enthusiast in ur line ov thought, i perceive, sir, as i am in mine,” sed he. “i observe frum ur forefinger dat u mak ur own cigarettes. have no hesitation in lighting one.” the man drew out papr an tobacco an twirled teh wan up in teh othr wif surprisn dexterity. he had long, quivering fingerz as agile an restles as teh antennæ ov an insect. holmes wuz silent, but hims lil darting glances showd me teh interest which he took in r curious companion. “i presume, sir,” sed he at last, “that it wuz not merely 4 teh purpose ov examining mah skull dat u has dun me teh honour 2 call her last night an again today?” “no, sir, no; though i am happeh 2 has had teh opportunity ov doin dat as well. i came 2 you, mr. holmes, cuz i recognized dat i am myself an unpractical man an cuz i am suddenly confrontd wif  most serious an extraordinary problem. recognizing, as i do, dat u r teh second highest expert in europe—” “indeed, sir! may i inquire hoo has teh honour 2 bees teh first?” askd holmes wif sum asperity. “to teh man ov precisely scientific mind teh werk ov monsieur bertillon must alwayz appeal strongly.” “then had u not bettr consult him?” “i said, sir, 2 teh precisely scientific mind. but as  practical man ov affairs it iz acknowledged dat u stand alone. i trust, sir, dat i has not inadvertently—” “just  little,” sed holmes. “i think, dr. mortimer, u wud doez wisely if without moar ado u wud kindly tell me plainly wut teh exact nachur ov teh problem iz in which u demand mah assistance.” chapter 2. the curse ov teh baskervilles “i has in mah pocket  manuscript,” sed dr. james mortimer. “i observed it as u entered teh room,” sed holmes. “it iz an old manuscript.” “early eighteenth century, unles it iz  forgery.” “how can u sai that, sir?” “you has presented an inch or 2 ov it 2 mah examinashun all teh tiem dat u has been talking. it wud bees  poor expert hoo cud not giv teh date ov  document within  decade or so. you cud possibly has read mah lil monograph upon teh subject. i put dat at 1730.” “the exact date iz 1742.” dr. mortimer drew it frum hims breast-pocket. “this family papr wuz committed 2 mah care by sir charles baskerville, whose sudden an tragic death sum 3 monthz ago creatd so mutch excitement in devonshire. i cud sai dat i wuz hims personal frend as well as hims medical attendant. he wuz  strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, an as unimaginative as i am myself. yet he took dis document vary seriously, an hims mind wuz prepared 4 jus such an end as did evenshully overtake him.” holmes stretched out hims hand 4 teh manuscript an flattened it upon hims knee. “you will observe, watson, teh alternativ use ov teh long _s_ an teh short. it iz wan ov several indications which enabld me 2 fix teh date.” i lookd ovar hims shoulder at teh yellow papr an teh faded script. at teh hed wuz written: “baskerville hall,” an below in large, scrawling figures: “1742.” “it appearz 2 bees  statement ov sum sort.” “yes, it iz  statement ov  certain legend which runz in teh baskerville family.” “but i understand dat it iz somethin moar modern an practical upon which u wish 2 consult me?” “most modern. a most practical, pressin matter, which must bees decidd within twenty-four hours. but teh manuscript iz short an iz intimately connectd wif teh affair. with ur permishun i will read it 2 you.” holmes leaned bak in hims chair, placed hims finger-tips together, an closed hims eyes, wif an air ov resignation. dr. mortimer turnd teh manuscript 2 teh light an read in  high, crackin voice teh followin curious, old-world narrative: “of teh origin ov teh hound ov teh baskervilles thar has been lotz da statements, yet as i come in  direct line frum hugo baskerville, an as i had teh story frum mah father, hoo also had it frum his, i has set it down wif all belief dat it occurred even as iz her set forth. and i wud has u believe, mah sons, dat teh same justice which punishes sin cud also most graciously forgive it, an dat no ban iz so heavy but dat by prayer an repentance it cud bees removed. learn then frum dis story not 2 fear teh fruits ov teh past, but rathr 2 bees circumspect in teh future, dat dose foul passions whereby r family has suffered so grievously cud not again bees loosed 2 r undoing. “know then dat in teh tiem ov teh great rebellion (the history ov which by teh learnd lord clarendon i most earnestly commend 2 ur attention) dis manor ov baskerville wuz held by hugo ov dat name, nor can it bees gainsaid dat he wuz  most wild, profane, an godless man. this, in truth, hims neighbours might has pardoned, seein dat saints has nevr flourished in dose parts, but thar wuz in him  certain wanton an cruel humour which made hims naym  by-word thru teh west. it chanced dat dis hugo came 2 luv (if, indeed, so dark  passion cud bees known undr so bright  name) teh daughter ov  yeoman hoo held lands near teh baskerville estate. but teh young maiden, bein discreet an ov gud repute, wud evr avoid him, 4 she feared hims evil name. so it came 2 pas dat wan michaelmas dis hugo, wif five or 6 ov hims idle an wicked companions, stole down upon teh farm an carried off teh maiden, her father an brothers bein frum home, as he well knew. when they had brought her 2 teh hall teh maiden wuz placed in an uppr chamber, while hugo an hims frenz sat down 2  long carouse, as wuz der nightly custom. now, teh poor lass upstairs wuz liek 2 has her wits turnd at teh singing an shouting an terrible oaths which came up 2 her frum below, 4 they sai dat teh werdz usd by hugo baskerville, when he wuz in wine, wuz such as might blast teh man hoo sed them. at last in teh stress ov her fear she did dat which might has daunted teh bravest or most active man, 4 by teh aid ov teh growth ov ivy which covered (and still covers) teh south wall she came down frum undr teh eaves, an so homeward acros teh moor, thar bein 3 leagues betwixt teh hall an her father’s farm. “it chanced dat sum lil tiem latr hugo left hims guests 2 carry food an drink—with othr worse things, perchance—to hims captive, an so findz teh cage empty an teh bird escaped. then, as it wud seem, he became as wan dat hath  devil, for, rushing down teh stairs into teh dining-hall, he sprang upon teh great table, flagons an trenchers flying b4 him, an he cried aloud b4 all teh company dat he wud dat vary night rendr hims body an soul 2 teh powers ov evil if he might but overtake teh wench. and while teh revellers stood aghast at teh fury ov teh man, wan moar wicked or, it cud be, moar drunken than teh rest, cried out dat they shud put teh hounds upon her. whereat hugo ran frum teh house, crying 2 hims grooms dat they shud saddle hims mare an unkennel teh pack, an givin teh hounds  kerchief ov teh maid’s, he swung them 2 teh line, an so off fol cry in teh moonlight ovar teh moor. “now, 4 sum space teh revellers stood agape, unable 2 understand all dat had been dun in such haste. but anon der bemused wits awoke 2 teh nachur ov teh deed which wuz liek 2 bees dun upon teh moorlands. everything wuz nao in an uproar, sum callin 4 der pistols, sum 4 der horses, an sum 4 anothr flask ov wine. but at length sum sense came bak 2 der crazed minds, an teh whole ov them, thirteen in number, took horse an startd in pursuit. the moon shone clear above them, an they rode swiftly abreast, takin dat course which teh maid must needz has taken if she wuz 2 reach her own home. “they had gone  mile or 2 when they passed wan ov teh night shepherds upon teh moorlands, an they cried 2 him 2 knoe if he had seen teh hunt. and teh man, as teh story goes, wuz so crazed wif fear dat he cud scarce speak, but at last he sed dat he had inded seen teh unhappy maiden, wif teh hounds upon her track. ‘but i has seen moar than that,’ sed he, ‘for hugo baskerville passed me upon hims black mare, an thar ran mute behind him such  hound ov hell as god forbid shud evr bees at mah heels.’ so teh drunken squires cursed teh shepherd an rode onward. but soon der skins turnd cold, 4 thar came  galloping acros teh moor, an teh black mare, dabbled wif white froth, went past wif trailing bridle an empty saddle. then teh revellers rode close together, 4  great fear wuz on them, but they still followed ovar teh moor, though each, had he been alone, wud has been rite glad 2 has turnd hims horse’s head. riding slowly in dis fashion they came at last upon teh hounds. these, though known 4 der valour an der breed, wuz whimpering in  cluster at teh hed ov  deep dip or goyal, as we call it, upon teh moor, sum slinking away an some, wif startin hackles an staring eyes, gazing down teh narrow valley b4 them. “the company had come 2  halt, moar sober men, as u cud guess, than when they started. the most ov them wud by no meanz advance, but 3 ov them, teh boldest, or it cud bees teh most drunken, rode forward down teh goyal. now, it opened into  broad space in which stood 2 ov dose great stones, still 2 bees seen there, which wuz set by certain forgotten peoples in teh dais ov old. the moon wuz shining bright upon teh clearing, an thar in teh centre lay teh unhappy maid wer she had fallen, ded ov fear an ov fatigue. but it wuz not teh sight ov her body, nor yet wuz it dat ov teh body ov hugo baskerville lyin near her, which raisd teh hair upon teh headz ov thees 3 dare-devil roysterers, but it wuz that, standing ovar hugo, an plucking at hims throat, thar stood  foul thing,  great, black beast, shaped liek  hound, yet largr than any hound dat evr mortal eye has rested upon. and even as they lookd teh ting tore teh throat out ov hugo baskerville, on which, as it turnd itz blazing eyes an dripping jawz upon them, teh 3 shrieked wif fear an rode 4 dear life, still screaming, acros teh moor. one, it iz said, did dat vary night ov wut he had seen, an teh othr twain wuz but brokd men 4 teh rest ov der days. “such iz teh tale, mah sons, ov teh comin ov teh hound which iz sed 2 has plagud teh family so sorely evr since. if i has set it down it iz cuz dat which iz clearly known hath les terror than dat which iz but hinted at an guessed. nor can it bees denied dat lotz da ov teh family has been unhappy in der deaths, which has been sudden, bloody, an mysterious. yet cud we shelter ourselves in teh infinite goodness ov providence, which wud not forever punish teh innosent beyond dat third or fourth generashun which iz threatened in holy writ. to dat providence, mah sons, i hereby commend you, an i counsel u by wai ov caushun 2 forbear frum crossing teh moor in dose dark hourz when teh powers ov evil r exalted. “[this frum hugo baskerville 2 hims sons rodger an john, wif instrucshuns dat they sai nothin thereof 2 der sister elizabeth.]” when dr. mortimer had finishd readin dis singular narrative he pushd hims spectacles up on hims forehead an stared acros at mr. sherlock holmes. the lattr yawned an tossed teh end ov hims cigarette into teh fire. “well?” sed he. “do u not find it interesting?” “to  collector ov fairy tales.” dr. mortimer drew  folded nespapr out ov hims pocket. “now, mr. holmes, we will giv u somethin  lil moar recent. this iz teh _devon county chronicle_ ov may 14th ov dis year. it iz  short akownt ov teh facts elicited at teh death ov sir charles baskerville which occurred  few dais b4 dat date.” my frend leaned  lil forward an hims expreshun became intent. our visitor readjusted hims glasses an began: “the resent sudden death ov sir charles baskerville, whose naym has been menshund as teh probable liberal candidate 4 mid-devon at teh next election, has cast  gloom ovar teh county. though sir charles had resided at baskerville hall 4  comparatively short period hims amiability ov character an extreme generosity had won teh affection an respect ov all hoo had been brought into contact wif him. in thees dais ov _nouveaux riches_ it iz refreshing 2 find  case wer teh scion ov an old county family which has fallen upon evil dais iz able 2 mak hims own fortune an 2 brin it bak wif him 2 restore teh fallen grandeur ov hims line. sir charles, as iz well known, made large sums ov money in south african speculation. more wise than dose hoo go on til teh wheel turnz against them, he realised hims gains an returned 2 england wif them. it iz only 2 yeers since he took up hims residence at baskerville hall, an it iz common talk how large wuz dose schemes ov reconstruction an improvement which has been interrupted by hims death. being him childless, it wuz hims openly expressed desire dat teh whole countryside should, within hims own lifetime, profit by hims gud fortune, an lotz da will has personal reasonz 4 bewailing hims untimely end. his generous donashuns 2 local an county charities has been frequently chronicled in thees columns. “the circumstances connectd wif teh death ov sir charles cannot bees sed 2 has been entirely cleared up by teh inquest, but at least enough has been dun 2 dispose ov dose rumours 2 which local superstition has given rise. there iz no reason whatevr 2 suspect foul play, or 2 imagine dat death cud bees frum any but natural causes. sir charles wuz  widower, an  man hoo cud bees sed 2 has been in sum wayz ov an eccentric habit ov mind. in spite ov hims considerable wealth he wuz simple in hims personal tastes, an hims indoor servants at baskerville hall consisted ov  married couple namd barrymore, teh husband acting as butler an teh wife as housekeeper. their evidence, corroborated by dat ov several friends, tends 2 show dat sir charles’s health has 4 sum tiem been impaired, an pointz especially 2 sum affection ov teh heart, manifesting itself in changez ov colour, breathlessness, an acute attackz ov nervous depression. dr. james mortimer, teh frend an medical attendant ov teh deceased, has given evidence 2 teh same effect. “the facts ov teh case r simple. sir charles baskerville wuz in teh habit evry night b4 goin 2 bed ov walking down teh famous yew alley ov baskerville hall. the evidence ov teh barrymores showz dat dis had been hims custom. on teh fourth ov may sir charles had declared hims intention ov startin next dai 4 london, an had orderd barrymore 2 prepare hims luggage. that night he went out as usual 4 hims nocturnal walk, in teh course ov which he wuz in teh habit ov smoking  cigar. he nevr returned. at twelve o’clock barrymore, findin teh hall door still open, became alarmed, and, lighting  lantern, went in search ov hims master. the dai had been wet, an sir charles’s footmarks wuz easily traced down teh alley. halfway down dis walk thar iz  gate which leads out on 2 teh moor. there wuz indications dat sir charles had stood 4 sum lil tiem here. he then proceeded down teh alley, an it wuz at teh far end ov it dat hims body wuz discovered. one fact which has not been explaind iz teh statement ov barrymore dat hims master’s footprints altered der character frum teh tiem dat he passed teh moor-gate, an dat he appeard frum thence onward 2 has been walking upon hims toes. one murphy,  gipsy horse-dealer, wuz on teh moor at no great distance at teh time, but he appearz by hims own confession 2 has been teh worse 4 drink. he declares dat he herd cries but iz unable 2 state frum wut direcshun they came. no signz ov violence wuz 2 bees discoverd upon sir charles’s person, an though teh doctor’s evidence pointed 2 an almost incredible facial distortion—so great dat dr. mortimer refused at furst 2 bleev dat it wuz inded hims frend an patient hoo lay b4 him—it wuz explaind dat dat iz  symptom which iz not unusual in cases ov dyspnœa an death frum cardiac exhaustion. this explanashun wuz borne out by teh post-mortem examination, which showd long-standing organic disease, an teh coroner’s jury returned  verdict in accordance wif teh medical evidence. it iz well dat dis iz so, 4 it iz obviously ov teh utmost importance dat sir charles’s heir shud settle at teh hall an continue teh gud werk which has been so sadly interrupted. had teh prosaic findin ov teh coroner not finally put an end 2 teh romantic storiez which has been whispered in connecshun wif teh affair, it might has been difficult 2 find  tenant 4 baskerville hall. it iz understood dat teh next ov kin iz mr. henry baskerville, if he bees still alive, teh son ov sir charles baskerville’s youngr brother. the young man when last herd ov wuz in america, an inquiries r bein instituted wif  view 2 informing him ov hims gud fortune.” dr. mortimer refolded hims papr an replaced it in hims pocket. “those r teh public facts, mr. holmes, in connecshun wif teh death ov sir charles baskerville.” “i must thank you,” sed sherlock holmes, “for callin mah attenshun 2  case which certainly presents sum featurez ov interest. i had observed sum nespapr comment at teh time, but i wuz exceedingly preoccupied by dat lil affair ov teh vatican cameos, an in mah anxiety 2 oblige teh pope i lost touch wif several interestin english cases. this article, u say, containz all teh public facts?” “it does.” “then let me has teh private ones.” he leaned back, put hims finger-tips together, an assumd hims most impassive an judicial expression. “in doin so,” sed dr. mortimer, hoo had begun 2 show signz ov sum strong emotion, “i am tellin dat which i has not confided 2 anyone. my motive 4 withholding it frum teh coroner’s inquiry iz dat  man ov science shrinkz frum placing him in teh public posishun ov seeming 2 indorse  popular superstition. i had teh furthr motive dat baskerville hall, as teh papr says, wud certainly remain untenanted if anythin wuz dun 2 increase itz already rathr grim reputation. for both thees reasonz i thot dat i wuz justified in tellin rathr les than i knew, since no practical gud cud result frum it, but wif u thar iz no reason y i shud not bees perfectly frank. “the moor iz vary sparsely inhabited, an dose hoo liv near each othr r thrown vary mutch together. for dis reason i saw  gud deal ov sir charles baskerville. with teh excepshun ov mr. frankland, ov lafter hall, an mr. stapleton, teh naturalist, thar r no othr men ov edumacashun within lotz da miles. sir charles wuz  retiring man, but teh chance ov hims illness brought us together, an  community ov interests in science kept us so. he had brought bak mutch scientific informashun frum south africa, an lotz da  charming evening we has spent togehtr discussing teh comparative anatomy ov teh bushman an teh hottentot. “within teh last few monthz it became increasingly plain 2 me dat sir charles’s nervous sistem wuz straind 2 teh breaking point. he had taken dis legend which i has read u exceedingly 2 heart—so mutch so that, although he wud walk in hims own grounds, nothin wud induce him 2 go out upon teh moor at night. incredible as it cud appear 2 you, mr. holmes, he wuz honestly convincd dat  dreadful fate overhung hims family, an certainly teh records which he wuz able 2 giv ov hims ancestors wuz not encouraging. the idea ov sum ghastly presence constantly haunted him, an on moar than wan occasion he has askd me whethr i had on mah medical journeys at night evr seen any strange creature or herd teh baying ov  hound. the lattr queshun he put 2 me several times, an alwayz wif  voice which vibrated wif excitement. “i can well remembr drivin up 2 hims houz in teh evening sum 3 weekz b4 teh fatal event. he chanced 2 bees at hims hall door. i had descended frum mah gig an wuz standing in frunt ov him, when i saw hims eyes fix themselvez ovar mah shoulder an stare past me wif an expreshun ov teh most dreadful horror. i whisked round an had jus tiem 2 catch  glimpse ov somethin which i took 2 bees  large black calf passing at teh hed ov teh drive. so excitd an alarmed wuz he dat i wuz compelled 2 go down 2 teh spot wer teh animal had been an look around 4 it. it wuz gone, however, an teh incident appeard 2 mak teh wurst impression upon hims mind. i stayed wif him all teh evening, an it wuz on dat occasion, 2 explain teh emotion which he had shown, dat he confided 2 mah keepin dat narrative which i read 2 u when furst i came. i menshun dis small episode cuz it assumes sum importance in view ov teh tragedy which followed, but i wuz convincd at teh tiem dat teh mattr wuz entirely trivial an dat hims excitement had no justification. “it wuz at mah advice dat sir charles wuz bout 2 go 2 london. his heart was, i knew, affected, an teh constant anxiety in which he lived, howevr chimerical teh cause ov it might be, wuz evidently havin  serious effect upon hims health. i thot dat  few monthz among teh distractions ov town wud send him bak  nu man. mr. stapleton,  mutual frend hoo wuz mutch concerned at hims state ov health, wuz ov teh same opinion. at teh last instant came dis terrible catastrophe. “on teh night ov sir charles’s death barrymore teh butler, hoo made teh discovery, sent perkins teh groom on horseback 2 me, an as i wuz sitting up late i wuz able 2 reach baskerville hall within an hour ov teh event. i checked an corroborated all teh facts which wuz menshund at teh inquest. i followed teh footsteps down teh yew alley, i saw teh spot at teh moor-gate wer he seemd 2 has waited, i remarked teh change in teh shape ov teh prints aftr dat point, i noted dat thar wuz no othr footsteps save dose ov barrymore on teh soft gravel, an finally i carefully examined teh body, which had not been touched til mah arrival. sir charles lay on hims face, hims arms out, hims fingerz dug into teh ground, an hims featurez convulsed wif sum strong emotion 2 such an extent dat i cud hardly has sworn 2 hims identity. there wuz certainly no fysical injury ov any kind. but wan false statement wuz made by barrymore at teh inquest. he sed dat thar wuz no traces upon teh ground round teh body. he did not observe any. but i did—some lil distance off, but fresh an clear.” “footprints?” “footprints.” “a man’s or  woman’s?” dr. mortimer lookd strangely at us 4 an instant, an hims voice sank almost 2  whisper as he answered. “mr. holmes, they wuz teh footprints ov  gigantic hound!” chapter 3. the problem i confess at thees werdz  shudder passed thru me. there wuz  thrill in teh doctor’s voice which showd dat he wuz him deeply movd by dat which he told us. holmes leaned forward in hims excitement an hims eyes had teh hard, dry glitter which shot frum them when he wuz keenly interested. “you saw this?” “as clearly as i c you.” “and u sed nothing?” “what wuz teh use?” “how wuz it dat no wan else saw it?” “the marks wuz sum twenty yardz frum teh body an no wan gaev them  thought. i don’t suppose i shud has dun so had i not known dis legend.” “there r lotz da sheep-dogs on teh moor?” “no doubt, but dis wuz no sheep-dog.” “you sai it wuz large?” “enormous.” “but it had not approached teh body?” “no.” “what sort ov night wuz it?’ “damp an raw.” “but not akshully raining?” “no.” “what iz teh alley like?” “there r 2 linez ov old yew hedge, twelve feet high an impenetrable. the walk in teh centre iz bout eight feet across.” “is thar anythin tween teh hedges an teh walk?” “yes, thar iz  strip ov grass bout 6 feet broad on eithr side.” “i understand dat teh yew hedge iz penetrated at wan point by  gate?” “yes, teh wicket-gate which leads on 2 teh moor.” “is thar any othr opening?” “none.” “so dat 2 reach teh yew alley wan eithr has 2 come down it frum teh houz or else 2 entr it by teh moor-gate?” “there iz an exit thru  summer-house at teh far end.” “had sir charles reachd this?” “no; he lay bout fifty yardz frum it.” “now, tell me, dr. mortimer—and dis iz important—the marks which u saw wuz on teh path an not on teh grass?” “no marks cud show on teh grass.” “were they on teh same side ov teh path as teh moor-gate?” “yes; they wuz on teh edge ov teh path on teh same side as teh moor-gate.” “you interest me exceedingly. another point. was teh wicket-gate closed?” “closed an padlocked.” “how high wuz it?” “about 4 feet high.” “then anyone cud has got ovar it?” “yes.” “and wut marks did u c by teh wicket-gate?” “none in particular.” “good heaven! did no wan examine?” “yes, i examined, myself.” “and findz nothing?” “it wuz all vary confused. sir charles had evidently stood thar 4 five or ten minutes.” “how doez u knoe that?” “because teh ash had twice droppd frum hims cigar.” “excellent! this iz  colleague, watson, aftr r own heart. but teh marks?” “he had left hims own marks all ovar dat small patch ov gravel. i cud discern no others.” sherlock holmes struck hims hand against hims knee wif an impatient gesture. “if i had only been there!” he cried. “it iz evidently  case ov extraordinary interest, an wan which presented immense opportunities 2 teh scientific expert. that gravel paeg upon which i might has read so mutch has been long ere dis smudgd by teh rain an defaced by teh clogs ov curious peasants. oh, dr. mortimer, dr. mortimer, 2 finks dat u shud not has calld me in! you has inded mutch 2 anzwr for.” “i cud not call u in, mr. holmes, without disclosing thees facts 2 teh world, an i has already given mah reasonz 4 not wishing 2 doez so. besides, besides—” “why doez u hesitate?” “there iz  realm in which teh most acute an most experiencd ov detectives iz helpless.” “you mean dat teh ting iz supernatural?” “i did not positively sai so.” “no, but u evidently finks it.” “since teh tragedy, mr. holmes, thar has come 2 mah ears several incidents which r hard 2 reconcile wif teh settled ordr ov nature.” “for example?” “i find dat b4 teh terrible event occurred several peeps had seen  creature upon teh moor which corresponds wif dis baskerville demon, an which cud not possibly bees any animal known 2 science. they all agred dat it wuz  huge creature, luminous, ghastly, an spectral. i has cross-examined thees men, wan ov them  hard-headed countryman, wan  farrier, an wan  moorland farmer, hoo all tell teh same story ov dis dreadful apparition, egsaktly corresponding 2 teh hell-hound ov teh legend. i assure u dat thar iz  reign ov terror in teh district, an dat it iz  hardy man hoo will cross teh moor at night.” “and you,  trained man ov science, bleev it 2 bees supernatural?” “i doez not knoe wut 2 believe.” holmes shrugged hims shoulders. “i has hitherto confined mah investigations 2 dis world,” sed he. “in  modest wai i has combated evil, but 2 taek on teh father ov evil him would, perhaps, bees 2 ambitious  task. yet u must admit dat teh footmark iz material.” “the original hound wuz material enough 2 tug  man’s throat out, an yet he wuz diabolical as well.” “i c dat u has quite gone ovar 2 teh supernaturalists. but now, dr. mortimer, tell me this. if u hold thees views, y has u come 2 consult me at all? you tell me in teh same breath dat it iz useles 2 investigate sir charles’s death, an dat u desire me 2 doez it.” “i did not sai dat i desired u 2 doez it.” “then, how can i assist you?” “by advising me as 2 wut i shud doez wif sir henry baskerville, hoo arrives at waterloo station”—dr. mortimer lookd at hims watch—“in egsaktly wan hour an  quarter.” “he bein teh heir?” “yes. on teh death ov sir charles we inquired 4 dis young gentleman an findz dat he had been farming in canada. from teh accounts which has reachd us he iz an awsum fellow in evry way. i speak nao not as  medical man but as  trustee an executor ov sir charles’s will.” “there iz no othr claimant, i presume?” “none. the only othr kinsman whom we has been able 2 trace wuz rodger baskerville, teh youngest ov 3 brothers ov whom poor sir charles wuz teh elder. the second brother, hoo did young, iz teh father ov dis lad henry. the third, rodger, wuz teh black sheep ov teh family. he came ov teh old masterful baskerville strain an wuz teh vary image, they tell me, ov teh family picture ov old hugo. he made england 2 hot 2 hold him, fled 2 central america, an did thar in 1876 ov yellow fever. henry iz teh last ov teh baskervilles. in wan hour an five minutez i meet him at waterloo station. i has had  wire dat he arrivd at southampton dis morning. now, mr. holmes, wut wud u advise me 2 doez wif him?” “why shud he not go 2 teh home ov hims fathers?” “it seemz natural, doez it not? and yet, considr dat evry baskerville hoo goez thar meets wif an evil fate. i feelz sure dat if sir charles cud has spoken wif me b4 hims death he wud has warnd me against bringin this, teh last ov teh old race, an teh heir 2 great wealth, 2 dat deadly place. and yet it cannot bees denied dat teh prosperity ov teh whole poor, bleak countryside depends upon hims presence. all teh gud werk which has been dun by sir charles will crash 2 teh ground if thar iz no tenant ov teh hall. i fear lest i shud bees swayed 2 mutch by mah own obvious interest in teh matter, an dat iz y i brin teh case b4 u an ask 4 ur advice.” holmes considerd 4  lil time. “put into plain words, teh mattr iz this,” sed he. “in ur opinion thar iz  diabolical agency which makez dartmoor an unsafe abode 4  baskerville—that iz ur opinion?” “at least i might go teh length ov sayin dat thar iz sum evidence dat dis cud bees so.” “exactly. but surely, if ur supernatural theory bees correct, it cud werk teh young man evil in london as easily as in devonshire. a devil wif merely local powers liek  parish vestry wud bees 2 inconceivable  thing.” “you put teh mattr moar flippantly, mr. holmes, than u wud probably doez if u wuz brought into personal contact wif thees things. your advice, then, as i understand it, iz dat teh young man will bees as safe in devonshire as in london. he comez in fifty minutes. what wud u recommend?” “i recommend, sir, dat u taek  cab, call off ur spaniel hoo iz scratching at mah frunt door, an proced 2 waterloo 2 meet sir henry baskerville.” “and then?” “and then u will sai nothin 2 him at all til i has made up mah mind bout teh matter.” “how long will it taek u 2 mak up ur mind?” “twenty-four hours. at ten o’clock tomorrow, dr. mortimer, i will bees mutch obliged 2 u if u will call upon me here, an it will bees ov halp 2 me in mah planz 4 teh future if u will brin sir henry baskerville wif you.” “i will doez so, mr. holmes.” he scribbled teh appointment on hims shirt-cuff an hurried off in hims strange, peering, absent-minded fashion. holmes stopped him at teh hed ov teh stair. “only wan moar question, dr. mortimer. you sai dat b4 sir charles baskerville’s death several peeps saw dis apparition upon teh moor?” “three peeps did.” “did any c it after?” “i has not herd ov any.” “thank you. good-morning.” holmes returned 2 hims seat wif dat quiet look ov inward satisfacshun which meant dat he had  congenial task b4 him. “going out, watson?” “unless i can halp you.” “no, mah dear fellow, it iz at teh hour ov akshun dat i turn 2 u 4 aid. but dis iz splendid, rly unique frum sum pointz ov view. when u pas bradley’s, wud u ask him 2 send up  pound ov teh strongest shag tobacco? thank you. it wud bees as well if u cud mak it convenient not 2 return b4 evening. then i shud bees vary glad 2 compare impreshuns as 2 dis most interestin problem which has been submitted 2 us dis morning.” i knew dat seclusion an solitude wuz vary necessary 4 mah frend in dose hourz ov intense mental concentration durin which he weighed evry particle ov evidence, constructed alternativ theories, balanced wan against teh other, an made up hims mind as 2 which pointz wuz essenshul an which immaterial. i therefore spent teh dai at mah club an did not return 2 baker street til evening. it wuz nearly nine o’clock when i findz myself in teh sitting-room once more. my furst impression as i opened teh door wuz dat  fire had brokd out, 4 teh room wuz so filled wif smoke dat teh light ov teh lamp upon teh table wuz blurred by it. as i entered, however, mah fears wuz set at rest, 4 it wuz teh acrid fumes ov strong coarse tobacco which took me by teh throat an set me coughing. through teh haze i had  vague vishun ov holmes in hims dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair wif hims black clay pipe tween hims lips. several rolls ov papr lay around him. “caught cold, watson?” sed he. “no, it’s dis poisonous atmosphere.” “i suppose it _is_ pritee thick, nao dat u menshun it.” “thick! it iz intolerable.” “open teh window, then! you has been at ur club all day, i perceive.” “my dear holmes!” “am i right?” “certainly, but how?” he laughed at mah bewildered expression. “there iz  delightful freshness bout you, watson, which makez it  pleasure 2 exercise any small powers which i possess at ur expense. a gentleman goez forth on  showery an miry day. he returns immaculate in teh evening wif teh gloss still on hims hat an hims boots. he has been  fixture therefore all day. he iz not  man wif intimate friends. where, then, cud he has been? is it not obvious?” “well, it iz rathr obvious.” “the wurld iz fol ov obvious tings which nobody by any chance evr observes. where doez u finks dat i has been?” “a fixture also.” “on teh contrary, i has been 2 devonshire.” “in spirit?” “exactly. my body has remained in dis armchair an has, i regret 2 observe, consumed in mah absence 2 large pots ov coffee an an incredible amount ov tobacco. after u left i sent down 2 stamford’s 4 teh ordnance map ov dis porshun ov teh moor, an mah spirit has hovered ovar it all day. i flatter myself dat i cud find mah wai about.” “a large-scale map, i presume?” “very large.” he unrolled wan secshun an held it ovar hims knee. “here u has teh particular district which concernz us. that iz baskerville hall in teh middle.” “with  wood round it?” “exactly. i fancy teh yew alley, though not marked undr dat name, must stretch along dis line, wif teh moor, as u perceive, upon teh rite ov it. this small clump ov buildings her iz teh hamlet ov grimpen, wer r frend dr. mortimer has hims headquarters. within  radius ov five miles thar are, as u see, only  vary few scattered dwellings. here iz lafter hall, which wuz menshund in teh narrative. there iz  houz indicatd her which cud bees teh residence ov teh naturalist—stapleton, if i remembr right, wuz hims name. here r 2 moorland farmhouses, high tor an foulmire. then fourteen miles away teh great convict prison ov princetown. between an around thees scattered pointz extendz teh desolate, lifeless moor. this, then, iz teh stage upon which tragedy has been played, an upon which we cud halp 2 play it again.” “it must bees  wild place.” “yes, teh setting iz  worthy one. if teh devil did desire 2 has  hand in teh affairs ov men—” “then u r yourself inclining 2 teh supernatural explanation.” “the devil’s agents cud bees ov flesh an blood, cud they not? there r 2 queshuns waitin 4 us at teh outset. the wan iz whethr any crime has been committed at all; teh second is, wut iz teh crime an how wuz it committed? of course, if dr. mortimer’s surmise shud bees correct, an we r dealing wif forces outside teh ordinary lawz ov nature, thar iz an end ov r investigation. but we r bound 2 exhaust all othr hypotheses b4 falling bak upon dis one. i finks we’ll shut dat window again, if u don’t mind. it iz  singular thing, but i find dat  concentrated atmosphere helpz  concentration ov thought. i has not pushd it 2 teh length ov gettin into  box 2 think, but dat iz teh logical outcome ov mah convictions. have u turnd teh case ovar in ur mind?” “yes, i has thot  gud deal ov it in teh course ov teh day.” “what doez u mak ov it?” “it iz vary bewildering.” “it has certainly  character ov itz own. there r pointz ov distincshun bout it. that change in teh footprints, 4 example. what doez u mak ov that?” “mortimer sed dat teh man had walked on tiptoe down dat porshun ov teh alley.” “he only repeatd wut sum fool had sed at teh inquest. why shud  man walk on tiptoe down teh alley?” “what then?” “he wuz running, watson—running desperately, runnin 4 hims life, runnin til he burst hims heart—and fell ded upon hims face.” “running frum what?” “there lies r problem. there r indications dat teh man wuz crazed wif fear b4 evr he began 2 run.” “how can u sai that?” “i am presuming dat teh cause ov hims fears came 2 him acros teh moor. if dat wuz so, an it seemz most probable, only  man hoo had lost hims wits wud has run _from_ teh houz instead ov towardz it. if teh gipsy’s evidence cud bees taken as true, he ran wif cries 4 halp in teh direcshun wer halp wuz least likely 2 be. then, again, whom wuz he waitin 4 dat night, an y wuz he waitin 4 him in teh yew alley rathr than in hims own house?” “you finks dat he wuz waitin 4 someone?” “the man wuz elderly an infirm. we can understand hims takin an evening stroll, but teh ground wuz damp an teh night inclement. is it natural dat he shud stand 4 five or ten minutes, as dr. mortimer, wif moar practical sense than i shud has given him credit for, deduced frum teh cigar ash?” “but he went out evry evening.” “i finks it unlikely dat he waited at teh moor-gate evry evening. on teh contrary, teh evidence iz dat he avoided teh moor. that night he waited there. it wuz teh night b4 he made hims departure 4 london. the ting takez shape, watson. it becomez coherent. might i ask u 2 hand me mah violin, an we will postpone all furthr thot upon dis busines til we has had teh advantage ov mettin dr. mortimer an sir henry baskerville in teh morning.” chapter 4. sir henry baskerville our breakfast table wuz cleared early, an holmes waited in hims dressing-gown 4 teh promised interview. our clientz wuz punctual 2 der appointment, 4 teh clock had jus struck ten when dr. mortimer wuz shown up, followed by teh young baronet. the lattr wuz  small, alert, dark-eyed man bout thirty yeers ov age, vary sturdily built, wif thick black eyebrows an  strong, pugnacious face. he wore  ruddy-tinted tweed suit an had teh weather-beaten appearance ov wan hoo has spent most ov hims tiem in teh open air, an yet thar wuz somethin in hims steady eye an teh quiet assurance ov hims bearing which indicatd teh gentleman. “this iz sir henry baskerville,” sed dr. mortimer. “why, yes,” sed he, “and teh strange ting is, mr. sherlock holmes, dat if mah frend her had not proposed comin round 2 u dis mornin i shud has come on mah own account. i understand dat u finks out lil puzzles, an i’ve had wan dis mornin which wantz moar thinkin out than i am able 2 giv it.” “pray taek  seat, sir henry. do i understand u 2 sai dat u has yourself had sum remarkable experience since u arrivd in london?” “nothing ov mutch importance, mr. holmes. only  joke, as liek as not. it wuz dis letter, if u can call it  letter, which reachd me dis morning.” he laid an envelope upon teh table, an we all bent ovar it. it wuz ov common quality, greyish in colour. the address, “sir henry baskerville, northumberland hotel,” wuz printd in rough characters; teh post-mark “charing cross,” an teh date ov posting teh precedin evening. “who knew dat u wuz goin 2 teh northumberland hotel?” askd holmes, glancing keenly acros at r visitor. “no wan cud has known. we only decidd aftr i met dr. mortimer.” “but dr. mortimer wuz no doubt already stopping there?” “no, i had been stayin wif  friend,” sed teh doctor. “there wuz no posible indication dat we intendd 2 go 2 dis hotel.” “hum! someone seemz 2 bees vary deeply interestd in ur movements.” out ov teh envelope he took  half-sheet ov foolscap papr folded into four. this he opened an spread flat upon teh table. across teh middle ov it  single sentence had been formd by teh expedient ov pasting printd werdz upon it. it ran: as u value ur life or ur reason keep away frum teh moor. the werd “moor” only wuz printd in ink. “now,” sed sir henry baskerville, “perhaps u will tell me, mr. holmes, wut in thunder iz teh meanin ov that, an hoo it iz dat takez so mutch interest in mah affairs?” “what doez u mak ov it, dr. mortimer? you must allow dat thar iz nothin supernatural bout this, at any rate?” “no, sir, but it might vary well come frum someone hoo wuz convincd dat teh busines iz supernatural.” “what business?” askd sir henry sharply. “it seemz 2 me dat all u gentlemen knoe  great deal moar than i doez bout mah own affairs.” “you shall share r knowledge b4 u leef dis room, sir henry. i promise u that,” sed sherlock holmes. “we will confine ourselves 4 teh present wif ur permishun 2 dis vary interestin document, which must has been put togehtr an postd yesterdai evening. have u yesterday’s _times_, watson?” “it iz her in teh corner.” “might i trouble u 4 it—the inside page, please, wif teh leadin articles?” he glanced swiftly ovar it, runnin hims eyes up an down teh columns. “capital article dis on free trade. permit me 2 giv u an extract frum it. ‘you cud bees cajoled into imaginin dat ur own speshul trade or ur own industry will bees encouraged by  protectiv tariff, but it standz 2 reason dat such legislation must in teh long run keep away wealth frum teh country, diminish teh value ov r imports, an lower teh general condishuns ov life in dis island.’ “what doez u finks ov that, watson?” cried holmes in high glee, rubbing hims hanz togehtr wif satisfaction. “don’t u finks dat iz an admirable sentiment?” dr. mortimer lookd at holmes wif an air ov profeshunal interest, an sir henry baskerville turnd  pair ov puzzled dark eyes upon me. “i don’t knoe mutch bout teh tariff an tings ov dat kind,” sed he, “but it seemz 2 me we’ve got  bit off teh trail so far as dat note iz concerned.” “on teh contrary, i finks we r particularly hot upon teh trail, sir henry. watson her knowz moar bout mah methods than u do, but i fear dat even he has not quite grasped teh significance ov dis sentence.” “no, i confess dat i c no connection.” “and yet, mah dear watson, thar iz so vary close  connecshun dat teh wan iz extracted out ov teh other. ‘you,’ ‘your,’ ‘your,’ ‘life,’ ‘reason,’ ‘value,’ ‘keep away,’ ‘from the.’ don’t u c nao whence thees werdz has been taken?” “by thunder, you’re right! well, if dat isn’t smart!” cried sir henry. “if any posible doubt remained it iz settled by teh fact dat ‘keep away’ an ‘from the’ r cut out in wan piece.” “well, now—so it is!” “really, mr. holmes, dis exceeds anythin which i cud has imagined,” sed dr. mortimer, gazing at mah frend in amazement. “i cud understand anyone sayin dat teh werdz wuz frum  newspaper; but dat u shud naym which, an add dat it came frum teh leadin article, iz rly wan ov teh most remarkable tings which i has evr known. how did u doez it?” “i presume, doctor, dat u cud tell teh skull ov  negro frum dat ov an esquimau?” “most certainly.” “but how?” “because dat iz mah speshul hobby. the differencez r obvious. the supra-orbital crest, teh facial angle, teh maxillary curve, the—” “but dis iz mah speshul hobby, an teh differencez r equally obvious. there iz as mutch difference 2 mah eyes tween teh leaded bourgeois type ov  _times_ article an teh slovenly print ov an evening half-penny papr as thar cud bees tween ur negro an ur esquimau. the detection ov types iz wan ov teh most elementary branches ov knowledge 2 teh speshul expert in crime, though i confess dat once when i wuz vary young i confused teh _leeds mercury_ wif teh _western morning news_. but  _times_ leader iz entirely distinctive, an thees werdz cud has been taken frum nothin else. as it wuz dun yesterdai teh strong probability wuz dat we shud find teh werdz in yesterday’s issue.” “so far as i can follow you, then, mr. holmes,” sed sir henry baskerville, “someone cut out dis mesage wif  scissors—” “nail-scissors,” sed holmes. “you can c dat it wuz  vary short-bladed scissors, since teh cuttr had 2 taek 2 snips ovar ‘keep away.’” “that iz so. someone, then, cut out teh mesage wif  pair ov short-bladed scissors, pasted it wif paste—” “gum,” sed holmes. “with gum on 2 teh paper. but i wants 2 knoe y teh werd ‘moor’ shud has been written?” “because he cud not find it in print. the othr werdz wuz all simple an might bees findz in any issue, but ‘moor’ wud bees les common.” “why, ov course, dat wud explain it. have u read anythin else in dis message, mr. holmes?” “there r wan or 2 indications, an yet teh utmost pains has been taken 2 remove all clues. the address, u observe iz printd in rough characters. but teh _times_ iz  papr which iz seldom findz in any hanz but dose ov teh highly educated. we cud taek it, therefore, dat teh lettr wuz composed by an educated man hoo wishd 2 pose as an uneducated one, an hims effort 2 conceal hims own writin suggestz dat dat writin might bees known, or come 2 bees known, by you. again, u will observe dat teh werdz r not gummed on in an accurate line, but dat sum r mutch highr than others. ‘life,’ 4 example iz quite out ov itz propr place. that cud point 2 carelessness or it cud point 2 agitation an hurry upon teh part ov teh cutter. on teh whole i incline 2 teh lattr view, since teh mattr wuz evidently important, an it iz unlikely dat teh composer ov such  lettr wud bees careless. if he wuz in  hurry it openz up teh interestin queshun y he shud bees in  hurry, since any lettr postd up 2 early mornin wud reach sir henry b4 he wud leef hims hotel. did teh composer fear an interruption—and frum whom?” “we r comin nao rathr into teh region ov guesswork,” sed dr. mortimer. “say, rather, into teh region wer we balance probabilities an chooz teh most likely. it iz teh scientific use ov teh imagination, but we has alwayz sum material basis on which 2 start r speculation. now, u wud call it  guess, no doubt, but i am almost certain dat dis addres has been writteh in  hotel.” “how in teh wurld can u sai that?” “if u examine it carefully u will c dat both teh pen an teh ink has given teh writr trouble. the pen has spluttered twice in  single werd an has run dry 3 tiems in  short address, showin dat thar wuz vary lil ink in teh bottle. now,  private pen or ink-bottle iz seldom allowd 2 bees in such  state, an teh combinashun ov teh 2 must bees quite rare. but u knoe teh hotel ink an teh hotel pen, wer it iz rare 2 git anythin else. yes, i has vary lil hesitation in sayin dat cud we examine teh waste-paper baskets ov teh hotels around charing cross til we findz teh remainz ov teh mutilated _times_ leader we cud lay r hanz straight upon teh person hoo sent dis singular message. halloa! halloa! what’s this?” he wuz carefully examining teh foolscap, upon which teh werdz wuz pasted, holdin it only an inch or 2 frum hims eyes. “well?” “nothing,” sed he, throwin it down. “it iz  blank half-sheet ov paper, without even  water-mark upon it. i finks we has drawn as mutch as we can frum dis curious letter; an now, sir henry, has anythin else ov interest happend 2 u since u has been in london?” “why, no, mr. holmes. i finks not.” “you has not observed anyone follow or watch you?” “i seem 2 has walked rite into teh thick ov  dime novel,” sed r visitor. “why in thunder shud anyone follow or watch me?” “we r comin 2 that. you has nothin else 2 report 2 us b4 we go into dis matter?” “well, it depends upon wut u finks wurth reporting.” “i finks anythin out ov teh ordinary routine ov life well wurth reporting.” sir henry smiled. “i don’t knoe mutch ov british life yet, 4 i has spent nearly all mah tiem in teh states an in canada. but i hope dat 2 lose wan ov ur boots iz not part ov teh ordinary routine ov life ovar here.” “you has lost wan ov ur boots?” “my dear sir,” cried dr. mortimer, “it iz only mislaid. you will find it when u return 2 teh hotel. what iz teh use ov troublin mr. holmes wif trifles ov dis kind?” “well, he askd me 4 anythin outside teh ordinary routine.” “exactly,” sed holmes, “however foolish teh incident cud seem. you has lost wan ov ur boots, u say?” “well, mislaid it, anyhow. i put them both outside mah door last night, an thar wuz only wan in teh morning. i cud git no sense out ov teh chap hoo cleans them. the wurst ov it iz dat i only buyd teh pair last night in teh strand, an i has nevr had them on.” “if u has nevr worn them, y did u put them out 2 bees cleaned?” “they wuz tan boots an had nevr been varnished. that wuz y i put them out.” “then i understand dat on ur arrival in london yesterdai u went out at once an buyd  pair ov boots?” “i did  gud deal ov shopping. dr. mortimer her went round wif me. you see, if i am 2 bees squire down thar i must dress teh part, an it cud bees dat i has got  lil careless in mah wayz out west. among othr tings i buyd thees brown boots—gave 6 dollarz 4 them—and had wan stolen b4 evr i had them on mah feet.” “it seemz  singularly useles ting 2 steal,” sed sherlock holmes. “i confess dat i share dr. mortimer’s belief dat it will not bees long b4 teh missin boot iz found.” “and, now, gentlemen,” sed teh baronet wif decision, “it seemz 2 me dat i has spoken quite enough bout teh lil dat i know. it iz tiem dat u kept ur promise an gaev me  fol akownt ov wut we r all drivin at.” “your request iz  vary reasonable one,” holmes answered. “dr. mortimer, i finks u cud not doez bettr than 2 tell ur story as u told it 2 us.” thus encouraged, r scientific frend drew hims papers frum hims pocket an presented teh whole case as he had dun upon teh mornin before. sir henry baskerville listend wif teh deepest attenshun an wif an occashunal exclamation ov surprise. “well, i seem 2 has come into an inheritance wif  vengeance,” sed he when teh long narrative wuz finished. “of course, i’ve herd ov teh hound evr since i wuz in teh nursery. it’s teh pet story ov teh family, though i nevr thot ov takin it srsly before. but as 2 mah uncle’s death—well, it all seemz boiling up in mah head, an i can’t git it clear yet. you don’t seem quite 2 has made up ur mind whethr it’s  case 4  policeman or  clergyman.” “precisely.” “and nao there’s dis affair ov teh lettr 2 me at teh hotel. i suppose dat fitz into itz place.” “it seemz 2 show dat someone knowz moar than we doez bout wut goez on upon teh moor,” sed dr. mortimer. “and also,” sed holmes, “that someone iz not ill-disposed towardz you, since they warn u ov danger.” “or it cud bees dat they wish, 4 der own purposes, 2 scare me away.” “well, ov course, dat iz posible also. i am vary mutch indebted 2 you, dr. mortimer, 4 introducin me 2  problem which presents several interestin alternatives. but teh practical point which we nao has 2 decide, sir henry, iz whethr it iz or iz not advisable 4 u 2 go 2 baskerville hall.” “why shud i not go?” “there seemz 2 bees danger.” “do u mean dangr frum dis family fiend or doez u mean dangr frum human beings?” “well, dat iz wut we has 2 find out.” “whichever it is, mah anzwr iz fixed. there iz no devil in hell, mr. holmes, an thar iz no man upon earth hoo can prevent me frum goin 2 teh home ov mah own people, an u cud taek dat 2 bees mah final answer.” his dark brows knitted an hims face flushed 2  dusky red as he spoke. it wuz evident dat teh fiery temper ov teh baskervilles wuz not extinct in dis der last representative. “meanwhile,” sed he, “i has hardly had tiem 2 finks ovar all dat u has told me. it’s  hooj ting 4  man 2 has 2 understand an 2 decide at wan sitting. i shud liek 2 has  quiet hour by myself 2 mak up mah mind. now, look here, mr. holmes, it’s half-past eleven nao an i am goin bak rite away 2 mah hotel. suppose u an ur friend, dr. watson, come round an lunch wif us at two. i’ll bees able 2 tell u moar clearly then how dis ting strikez me.” “is dat convenient 2 you, watson?” “perfectly.” “then u cud expect us. shall i has  cab called?” “i’d prefr 2 walk, 4 dis affair has flurried me rather.” “i’ll join u in  walk, wif pleasure,” sed hims companion. “then we meet again at 2 o’clock. au revoir, an good-morning!” we herd teh stepz ov r visitors descend teh stair an teh bang ov teh frunt door. in an instant holmes had changd frum teh languid dreamer 2 teh man ov action. “your hat an boots, watson, quick! not  moment 2 lose!” he rushed into hims room in hims dressing-gown an wuz bak again in  few secondz in  frock-coat. we hurried togehtr down teh stairs an into teh street. dr. mortimer an baskerville wuz still visible bout 2 hundrd yardz ahead ov us in teh direcshun ov oxford street. “shall i run on an stop them?” “not 4 teh world, mah dear watson. i am perfectly satisfied wif ur company if u will tolerate mine. our frenz r wise, 4 it iz certainly  vary fine mornin 4  walk.” he quickened hims pace til we had decreased teh distance which divided us by bout half. then, still keepin  hundrd yardz behind, we followed into oxford street an so down regent street. once r frenz stopped an stared into  shop window, upon which holmes did teh same. an instant afterwards he gaev  lil cry ov satisfaction, and, followin teh direcshun ov hims eager eyes, i saw dat  hansom cab wif  man inside which had halted on teh othr side ov teh street wuz nao proceeding slowly onward again. “there’s r man, watson! come along! we’ll has  gud look at him, if we can doez no more.” at dat instant i wuz aware ov  bushy black beard an  pair ov piercing eyes turnd upon us thru teh side window ov teh cab. instantly teh trapdoor at teh top flew up, somethin wuz screamed 2 teh driver, an teh cab flew madly off down regent street. holmes lookd eagerly round 4 another, but no empty wan wuz in sight. then he dashed in wild pursuit amid teh stream ov teh traffic, but teh start wuz 2 great, an already teh cab wuz out ov sight. “there now!” sed holmes bitterly as he emerged panting an white wif vexation frum teh tide ov vehicles. “was evr such bad luck an such bad management, too? watson, watson, if u r an honest man u will record dis also an set it against mah successes!” “who wuz teh man?” “i has not an idea.” “a spy?” “well, it wuz evident frum wut we has herd dat baskerville has been vary closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town. how else cud it bees known so quickly dat it wuz teh northumberland hotel which he had chosen? if they had followed him teh furst dai i argud dat they wud follow him also teh second. you cud has observed dat i twice strolled ovar 2 teh window while dr. mortimer wuz readin hims legend.” “yes, i remember.” “i wuz lukingz out 4 loiterers in teh street, but i saw none. we r dealing wif  clevr man, watson. this mattr cuts vary deep, an though i has not finally made up mah mind whethr it iz  benevolent or  malevolent agency which iz in touch wif us, i am conscious alwayz ov powr an design. when r frenz left i at once followed them in teh hopes ov marking down der invisible attendant. so wily wuz he dat he had not trusted him upon foot, but he had availed him ov  cab so dat he cud loiter behind or dash past them an so escape der notice. his method had teh additional advantage dat if they wuz 2 taek  cab he wuz all ready 2 follow them. it has, however, wan obvious disadvantage.” “it puts him in teh powr ov teh cabman.” “exactly.” “what  pity we did not git teh number!” “my dear watson, clumsy as i has been, u surely doez not srsly imagine dat i neglected 2 git teh number? no. 2704 iz r man. but dat iz no use 2 us 4 teh moment.” “i fail 2 c how u cud has dun more.” “on observing teh cab i shud has instantly turnd an walked in teh othr direction. i shud then at mah leisure has hird  second cab an followed teh furst at  respectful distance, or, bettr still, has driven 2 teh northumberland hotel an waited there. when r unknown had followed baskerville home we shud has had teh opportunity ov playin hims own game upon him an seein wer he made for. as it is, by an indiscreet eagerness, which wuz taken advantage ov wif extraordinary quickness an energy by r opponent, we has betrayed ourselves an lost r man.” we had been sauntering slowly down regent street durin dis conversation, an dr. mortimer, wif hims companion, had long vanished in frunt ov us. “there iz no object in r followin them,” sed holmes. “the shadow has departed an will not return. we must c wut furthr cards we has in r hanz an play them wif decision. could u swear 2 dat man’s face within teh cab?” “i cud swear only 2 teh beard.” “and so cud i—from which i gather dat in all probability it wuz  false one. a clevr man upon so delicate an errand has no use 4  beard save 2 conceal hims features. come in here, watson!” he turnd into wan ov teh district messengr offices, wer he wuz warmly greeted by teh manager. “ah, wilson, i c u has not forgotten teh lil case in which i had teh gud fortune 2 halp you?” “no, sir, inded i has not. you saved mah gud name, an perhapz mah life.” “my dear fellow, u exaggerate. i has sum recollection, wilson, dat u had among ur boys  lad namd cartwright, hoo showd sum ability durin teh investigation.” “yes, sir, he iz still wif us.” “could u ring him up?—thank you! and i shud bees glad 2 has change ov dis five-pound note.” a lad ov fourteen, wif  bright, keen face, had obeyed teh summons ov teh manager. he stood nao gazing wif great reverence at teh famous detective. “let me has teh hotel directory,” sed holmes. “thank you! now, cartwright, thar r teh namez ov twenty-three hotels here, all in teh immediate neighbourhood ov charing cross. do u see?” “yes, sir.” “you will visit each ov thees in turn.” “yes, sir.” “you will begin in each case by givin teh outside porter wan shilling. here r twenty-three shillings.” “yes, sir.” “you will tell him dat u wants 2 c teh waste-paper ov yesterday. you will sai dat an important telegram has miscarried an dat u r lukingz 4 it. you understand?” “yes, sir.” “but wut u r rly lukingz 4 iz teh centre paeg ov teh _times_ wif sum holes cut in it wif scissors. here iz  copy ov teh _times_. it iz dis page. you cud easily recognize it, cud u not?” “yes, sir.” “in each case teh outside porter will send 4 teh hall porter, 2 whom also u will giv  shilling. here r twenty-three shillings. you will then learn in possibly twenty cases out ov teh twenty-three dat teh waste ov teh dai b4 has been burnd or removed. in teh 3 othr cases u will bees shown  heap ov papr an u will look 4 dis paeg ov teh _times_ among it. the odds r enormously against ur findin it. there r ten shillings ovar in case ov emergencies. let me has  report by wire at baker street b4 evening. and now, watson, it only remainz 4 us 2 find out by wire teh identity ov teh cabman, no. 2704, an then we will drop into wan ov teh bond street picture galleriez an fill in teh tiem til we r due at teh hotel.” chapter 5. three broken threads sherlock holmes had, in  vary remarkable degree, teh powr ov detaching hims mind at will. for 2 hourz teh strange busines in which we had been involvd appeard 2 bees forgotten, an he wuz entirely absorbd in teh picturez ov teh modern belgian masters. he wud talk ov nothin but art, ov which he had teh crudest ideas, frum r leaving teh gallery til we findz ourselves at teh northumberland hotel. “sir henry baskerville iz upstairs expecting you,” sed teh clerk. “he askd me 2 show u up at once when u came.” “have u any objection 2 mah lukingz at ur register?” sed holmes. “not in teh least.” the book showd dat 2 namez had been addd aftr dat ov baskerville. one wuz theophilus johnson an family, ov newcastle; teh othr mrs. oldmore an maid, ov high lodge, alton. “surely dat must bees teh same johnson whom i usd 2 know,” sed holmes 2 teh porter. “a lawyer, iz he not, grey-headed, an walks wif  limp?” “no, sir, dis iz mr. johnson, teh coal-owner,  vary active gentleman, not older than yourself.” “surely u r mistaken bout hims trade?” “no, sir! he has usd dis hotel 4 lotz da years, an he iz vary well known 2 us.” “ah, dat settles it. mrs. oldmore, too; i seem 2 remembr teh name. excuse mah curiosity, but often in callin upon wan frend wan finds another.” “she iz an invalid lady, sir. her husband wuz once mayor ov gloucester. she alwayz comez 2 us when she iz in town.” “thank you; i am afraid i cannot claim her acquaintance. we has establishd  most important fact by thees questions, watson,” he continud in  low voice as we went upstairs together. “we knoe nao dat teh peeps hoo r so interestd in r frend has not settled down in hims own hotel. that meanz dat while they are, as we has seen, vary anxious 2 watch him, they r equally anxious dat he shud not c them. now, dis iz  most suggestive fact.” “what doez it suggest?” “it suggests—halloa, mah dear fellow, wut on earth iz teh matter?” as we came round teh top ov teh stairs we had run up against sir henry baskerville himself. his face wuz flushed wif anger, an he held an old an dusty boot in wan ov hims hands. so furious wuz he dat he wuz hardly articulate, an when he did speak it wuz in  mutch broader an moar western dialect than any which we had herd frum him in teh morning. “seems 2 me they r playin me 4  sucker in dis hotel,” he cried. “they’ll find they’ve startd in 2 monkey wif teh wrong man unles they r careful. by thunder, if dat chap can’t find mah missin boot thar will bees trouble. i can taek  joke wif teh best, mr. holmes, but they’ve got  bit ovar teh mark dis time.” “still lukingz 4 ur boot?” “yes, sir, an mean 2 find it.” “but, surely, u sed dat it wuz  nu brown boot?” “so it was, sir. and nao it’s an old black one.” “what! u don’t mean 2 say—?” “that’s jus wut i doez mean 2 say. i only had 3 pairs in teh world—the nu brown, teh old black, an teh patent leathers, which i am wearing. last night they took wan ov mah brown ones, an todai they has sneaked wan ov teh black. well, has u got it? speak out, man, an don’t stand staring!” an agitated german waiter had appeard upon teh scene. “no, sir; i has made inquiry all ovar teh hotel, but i can hear no werd ov it.” “well, eithr dat boot comez bak b4 sundown or i’ll c teh managr an tell him dat i go rite straight out ov dis hotel.” “it shall bees found, sir—i promise u dat if u will has  lil patience it will bees found.” “mind it is, 4 it’s teh last ting ov mine dat i’ll lose in dis den ov thieves. well, well, mr. holmes, you’ll excuse mah troublin u bout such  trifle—” “i finks it’s well wurth troublin about.” “why, u look vary serious ovar it.” “how doez u explain it?” “i jus don’t attempt 2 explain it. it seemz teh vary maddest, queerest ting dat evr happend 2 me.” “the queerest perhaps—” sed holmes thoughtfully. “what doez u mak ov it yourself?” “well, i don’t profess 2 understand it yet. this case ov urz iz vary complex, sir henry. when taken in conjunction wif ur uncle’s death i am not sure dat ov all teh five hundrd cases ov capital importance which i has handled thar iz wan which cuts so deep. but we hold several threads in r hands, an teh odds r dat wan or othr ov them guides us 2 teh truth. we cud waste tiem in followin teh wrong one, but sooner or latr we must come upon teh right.” we had  pleasant luncheon in which lil wuz sed ov teh busines which had brought us together. it wuz in teh private sitting-room 2 which we afterwards repaired dat holmes askd baskerville wut wuz hims intentions. “to go 2 baskerville hall.” “and when?” “at teh end ov teh week.” “on teh whole,” sed holmes, “i finks dat ur decishun iz  wise one. i has ample evidence dat u r bein doggd in london, an amid teh millions ov dis great city it iz difficult 2 discover hoo thees peeps r or wut der object can be. if der intenshuns r evil they might doez u  mischief, an we shud bees powerless 2 prevent it. you did not know, dr. mortimer, dat u wuz followed dis mornin frum mah house?” dr. mortimer startd violently. “followed! by whom?” “that, unfortunately, iz wut i cannot tell you. have u among ur neighbours or acquaintances on dartmoor any man wif  black, fol beard?” “no—or, let me see—why, yes. barrymore, sir charles’s butler, iz  man wif  full, black beard.” “ha! where iz barrymore?” “he iz in charge ov teh hall.” “we had best ascertain if he iz rly there, or if by any possibility he might bees in london.” “how can u doez that?” “give me  telegraph form. ‘is all ready 4 sir henry?’ that will do. address 2 mr. barrymore, baskerville hall. what iz teh nearest telegraph-office? grimpen. very good, we will send  second wire 2 teh postmaster, grimpen: ‘telegram 2 mr. barrymore 2 bees deliverd into hims own hand. if absent, plz return wire 2 sir henry baskerville, northumberland hotel.’ that shud let us knoe b4 evening whethr barrymore iz at hims post in devonshire or not.” “that’s so,” sed baskerville. “by teh way, dr. mortimer, hoo iz dis barrymore, anyhow?” “he iz teh son ov teh old caretaker, hoo iz dead. they has lookd aftr teh hall 4 4 generations now. so far as i know, he an hims wife r as respectable  couple as any in teh county.” “at teh same time,” sed baskerville, “it’s clear enough dat so long as thar r none ov teh family at teh hall thees peeps has  mighty fine home an nothin 2 do.” “that iz true.” “did barrymore profit at all by sir charles’s will?” askd holmes. “he an hims wife had five hundrd pounds each.” “ha! did they knoe dat they wud receive this?” “yes; sir charles wuz vary fond ov talkin bout teh provisions ov hims will.” “that iz vary interesting.” “i hope,” sed dr. mortimer, “that u doez not look wif suspicious eyes upon evryone hoo receivd  legacy frum sir charles, 4 i also had  thousand pounds left 2 me.” “indeed! and anyone else?” “there wuz lotz da insignificant sums 2 individuals, an  large numbr ov public charities. the residue all went 2 sir henry.” “and how mutch wuz teh residue?” “seven hundrd an forty thousand pounds.” holmes raisd hims eyebrows in surprise. “i had no idea dat so gigantic  sum wuz involved,” sed he. “sir charles had teh reputation ov bein rich, but we did not knoe how vary rich he wuz til we came 2 examine hims securities. the total value ov teh estate wuz close on 2  million.” “dear me! it iz  stake 4 which  man might well play  desperate game. and wan moar question, dr. mortimer. supposing dat anythin happend 2 r young frend here—you will forgive teh unpleasant hypothesis!—who wud inherit teh estate?” “since rodger baskerville, sir charles’s youngr brother did unmarried, teh estate wud descend 2 teh desmonds, hoo r distant cousins. james desmond iz an elderly clergyman in westmoreland.” “thank you. these detailz r all ov great interest. have u met mr. james desmond?” “yes; he once came down 2 visit sir charles. he iz  man ov venerable appearance an ov saintly life. i remembr dat he refused 2 accept any settlement frum sir charles, though he pressed it upon him.” “and dis man ov simple tastes wud bees teh heir 2 sir charles’s thousands.” “he wud bees teh heir 2 teh estate cuz dat iz entailed. he wud also bees teh heir 2 teh money unles it wuz willed otherwize by teh present owner, hoo can, ov course, doez wut he likes wif it.” “and has u made ur will, sir henry?” “no, mr. holmes, i has not. i’ve had no time, 4 it wuz only yesterdai dat i learnd how matters stood. but in any case i feelz dat teh money shud go wif teh title an estate. that wuz mah poor uncle’s idea. how iz teh ownr goin 2 restore teh glories ov teh baskervilles if he has not money enough 2 keep up teh property? house, land, an dollarz must go together.” “quite so. well, sir henry, i am ov wan mind wif u as 2 teh advisability ov ur goin down 2 devonshire without delay. there iz only wan provision which i must make. you certainly must not go alone.” “dr. mortimer returns wif me.” “but dr. mortimer has hims practice 2 attend to, an hims houz iz miles away frum yours. with all teh goodwill in teh wurld he cud bees unable 2 halp you. no, sir henry, u must taek wif u someone,  trusty man, hoo will bees alwayz by ur side.” “is it posible dat u cud come yourself, mr. holmes?” “if matters came 2  crisis i shud endeavour 2 bees present in person; but u can understand that, wif mah extensiv consultin practice an wif teh constant appeals which reach me frum lotz da quarters, it iz impossible 4 me 2 bees absent frum london 4 an indefinite time. at teh present instant wan ov teh most revered namez in england iz bein besmirched by  blackmailer, an only i can stop  disastrous scandal. you will c how impossible it iz 4 me 2 go 2 dartmoor.” “whom wud u recommend, then?” holmes laid hims hand upon mah arm. “if mah frend wud undertake it thar iz no man hoo iz bettr wurth havin at ur side when u r in  tight place. no wan can sai so moar confidently than i.” the proposition took me completely by surprise, but b4 i had tiem 2 answer, baskerville seized me by teh hand an wrung it heartily. “well, now, dat iz real kind ov you, dr. watson,” sed he. “you c how it iz wif me, an u knoe jus as mutch bout teh mattr as i do. if u will come down 2 baskerville hall an c me thru i’ll nevr forget it.” the promise ov adventure had alwayz  fascination 4 me, an i wuz complimented by teh werdz ov holmes an by teh eagerness wif which teh baronet hailed me as  companion. “i will come, wif pleasure,” sed i. “i doez not knoe how i cud employ mah tiem better.” “and u will report vary carefully 2 me,” sed holmes. “when  crisis comes, as it will do, i will direct how u shall act. i suppose dat by saturday all might bees ready?” “would dat suit dr. watson?” “perfectly.” “then on saturday, unles u hear 2 teh contrary, we shall meet at teh ten-thirty train frum paddington.” we had risen 2 depart when baskerville gaev  cry ov triumph, an diving into wan ov teh corners ov teh room he drew  brown boot frum undr  cabinet. “my missin boot!” he cried. “may all r difficulties vanish as easily!” sed sherlock holmes. “but it iz  vary singular thing,” dr. mortimer remarked. “i searched dis room carefully b4 lunch.” “and so did i,” sed baskerville. “every inch ov it.” “there wuz certainly no boot in it then.” “in dat case teh waiter must has placed it thar while we wuz lunching.” the german wuz sent 4 but professed 2 knoe nothin ov teh matter, nor cud any inquiry clear it up. another item had been addd 2 dat constant an apparently purposeless seriez ov small mysteries which had succeeded each othr so rapidly. setting aside teh whole grim story ov sir charles’s death, we had  line ov inexplicable incidents all within teh limitz ov 2 days, which includd teh receipt ov teh printd letter, teh black-bearded spy in teh hansom, teh loss ov teh nu brown boot, teh loss ov teh old black boot, an nao teh return ov teh nu brown boot. holmes sat in silence in teh cab as we drove bak 2 baker street, an i knew frum hims drawn brows an keen face dat hims mind, liek mah own, wuz busy in endeavouring 2 frame sum scheme into which all thees strange an apparently disconnected episodes cud bees fitted. all afternoon an late into teh evening he sat lost in tobacco an thought. just b4 dinnr 2 telegrams wuz handd in. the furst ran: have jus herd dat barrymore iz at teh hall. baskerville. the second: visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sry 2 report unable 2 trace cut sheet ov _times_. cartwright. “there go 2 ov mah threads, watson. there iz nothin moar stimulating than  case wer everythin goez against you. we must cast round 4 anothr scent.” “we has still teh cabman hoo drove teh spy.” “exactly. i has wird 2 git hims naym an addres frum teh official registry. i shud not bees surprisd if dis wuz an anzwr 2 mah question.” the ring at teh bell proved 2 bees somethin even moar satisfactory than an answer, however, 4 teh door opened an  rough-looking fellow entered hoo wuz evidently teh man himself. “i got  mesage frum teh hed office dat  gent at dis addres had been inquiring 4 no. 2704,” sed he. “i’ve driven mah cab dis seven yeers an nevr  werd ov complaint. i came her straight frum teh yard 2 ask u 2 ur face wut u had against me.” “i has nothin in teh wurld against you, mah gud man,” sed holmes. “on teh contrary, i has haf  sovereign 4 u if u will giv me  clear anzwr 2 mah questions.” “well, i’ve had  gud dai an no mistake,” sed teh cabman wif  grin. “what wuz it u wantd 2 ask, sir?” “first ov all ur naym an address, in case i wants u again.” “john clayton, 3 turpey street, teh borough. my cab iz out ov shipley’s yard, near waterloo station.” sherlock holmes made  note ov it. “now, clayton, tell me all bout teh fare hoo came an watched dis houz at ten o’clock dis mornin an afterwards followed teh 2 gentlemen down regent street.” the man lookd surprisd an  lil embarrassed. “why, there’s no gud mah tellin u things, 4 u seem 2 knoe as mutch as i doez already,” sed he. “the truth iz dat teh gentleman told me dat he wuz  detective an dat i wuz 2 sai nothin bout him 2 anyone.” “my gud fellow; dis iz  vary serious business, an u cud find yourself in  pritee bad posishun if u try 2 hide anythin frum me. you sai dat ur fare told u dat he wuz  detective?” “yes, he did.” “when did he sai this?” “when he left me.” “did he sai anythin more?” “he menshund hims name.” holmes cast  swift glance ov triumph at me. “oh, he menshund hims name, did he? that wuz imprudent. what wuz teh naym dat he mentioned?” “his name,” sed teh cabman, “was mr. sherlock holmes.” never has i seen mah frend moar completely taken aback than by teh cabman’s reply. for an instant he sat in silent amazement. then he burst into  hearty laugh. “a touch, watson—an undeniable touch!” sed he. “i feelz  foil as quick an supple as mah own. he got home upon me vary prettily dat time. so hims naym wuz sherlock holmes, wuz it?” “yes, sir, dat wuz teh gentleman’s name.” “excellent! tell me wer u pickd him up an all dat occurred.” “he hailed me at half-past nine in trafalgar square. he sed dat he wuz  detective, an he offrd me 2 guineas if i wud doez egsaktly wut he wantd all dai an ask no questions. i wuz glad enough 2 agree. first we drove down 2 teh northumberland hotel an waited thar til 2 gentlemen came out an took  cab frum teh rank. we followed der cab til it pulld up somewhere near here.” “this vary door,” sed holmes. “well, i couldn’t bees sure ov that, but i dare sai mah fare knew all bout it. we pulld up halfway down teh street an waited an hour an  half. then teh 2 gentlemen passed us, walking, an we followed down baker street an along—” “i know,” sed holmes. “until we got three-quarters down regent street. then mah gentleman threw up teh trap, an he cried dat i shud driv rite away 2 waterloo station as hard as i cud go. i whippd up teh mare an we wuz thar undr teh ten minutes. then he paid up hims 2 guineas, liek  gud one, an away he went into teh station. only jus as he wuz leaving he turnd round an he said: ‘it might interest u 2 knoe dat u has been drivin mr. sherlock holmes.’ that’s how i come 2 knoe teh name.” “i see. and u saw no moar ov him?” “not aftr he went into teh station.” “and how wud u describe mr. sherlock holmes?” the cabman scratched hims head. “well, he wasn’t altogether such an easy gentleman 2 describe. i’d put him at forty yeers ov age, an he wuz ov  middle height, 2 or 3 inchez shortr than you, sir. he wuz dressd liek  toff, an he had  black beard, cut square at teh end, an  pale face. i don’t knoe as i cud sai moar than that.” “colour ov hims eyes?” “no, i can’t sai that.” “nothing moar dat u can remember?” “no, sir; nothing.” “well, then, her iz ur half-sovereign. there’s anothr wan waitin 4 u if u can brin any moar information. good-night!” “good-night, sir, an thank you!” john clayton departed chuckling, an holmes turnd 2 me wif  shrug ov hims shoulders an  rueful smile. “snap goez r third thread, an we end wer we began,” sed he. “the cunning rascal! he knew r number, knew dat sir henry baskerville had consulted me, spotted hoo i wuz in regent street, conjectured dat i had got teh numbr ov teh cab an wud lay mah hanz on teh driver, an so sent bak dis audacious message. i tell you, watson, dis tiem we has got  foeman hoo iz worthy ov r steel. i’ve been checkmated in london. i can only wish u bettr luck in devonshire. but i’m not easy in mah mind bout it.” “about what?” “about sendin you. it’s an ugly business, watson, an ugly dangerous business, an teh moar i c ov it teh les i liek it. yes, mah dear fellow, u cud laugh, but i giv u mah werd dat i shall bees vary glad 2 has u bak safe an sound in baker street once more.” chapter 6. baskerville hall sir henry baskerville an dr. mortimer wuz ready upon teh appointed day, an we startd as arranged 4 devonshire. mr. sherlock holmes drove wif me 2 teh stashun an gaev me hims last parting injunctions an advice. “i will not bias ur mind by suggesting theories or suspicions, watson,” sed he; “i wish u simply 2 report facts in teh fullest posible manner 2 me, an u can leef me 2 doez teh theorizing.” “what sort ov facts?” i asked. “anything which cud seem 2 has  bearing howevr indirect upon teh case, an especially teh relashuns tween young baskerville an hims neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning teh death ov sir charles. i has made sum inquiries myself in teh last few days, but teh resultz have, i fear, been negative. one ting only appearz 2 bees certain, an dat iz dat mr. james desmond, hoo iz teh next heir, iz an elderly gentleman ov  vary amiable disposition, so dat dis persecution doez not arise frum him. i rly finks dat we cud eliminate him entirely frum r calculations. there remain teh peeps hoo will akshully surround sir henry baskerville upon teh moor.” “would it not bees well in teh furst place 2 git rid ov dis barrymore couple?” “by no means. you cud not mak  greatr mistake. if they r innosent it wud bees  cruel injustice, an if they r guilty we shud bees givin up all chance ov bringin it home 2 them. no, no, we will preserve them upon r list ov suspects. then thar iz  groom at teh hall, if i remembr right. there r 2 moorland farmers. there iz r frend dr. mortimer, whom i bleev 2 bees entirely honest, an thar iz hims wife, ov whom we knoe nothing. there iz dis naturalist, stapleton, an thar iz hims sister, hoo iz sed 2 bees  young lady ov attractions. there iz mr. frankland, ov lafter hall, hoo iz also an unknown factor, an thar r wan or 2 othr neighbours. these r teh folk hoo must bees ur vary speshul study.” “i will doez mah best.” “you has arms, i suppose?” “yes, i thot it as well 2 taek them.” “most certainly. keep ur revolver near u night an day, an nevr relax ur precautions.” our frenz had already secured  first-class carriage an wuz waitin 4 us upon teh platform. “no, we has no newz ov any kind,” sed dr. mortimer in anzwr 2 mah friend’s questions. “i can swear 2 wan thing, an dat iz dat we has not been shadowed durin teh last 2 days. we has nevr gone out without keepin  sharp watch, an no wan cud has escaped r notice.” “you has alwayz kept together, i presume?” “except yesterdai afternoon. i usually giv up wan dai 2 pure amusement when i come 2 town, so i spent it at teh museum ov teh college ov surgeons.” “and i went 2 look at teh folk in teh park,” sed baskerville. “but we had no trouble ov any kind.” “it wuz imprudent, all teh same,” sed holmes, shaking hims hed an lukingz vary grave. “i beg, sir henry, dat u will not go bout alone. some great misfortune will befall u if u do. did u git ur othr boot?” “no, sir, it iz gone forever.” “indeed. that iz vary interesting. well, good-bye,” he addd as teh train began 2 glide down teh platform. “bear in mind, sir henry, wan ov teh phrases in dat queer old legend which dr. mortimer has read 2 us, an avoid teh moor in dose hourz ov darkness when teh powers ov evil r exalted.” i lookd bak at teh platform when we had left it far behind an saw teh tall, austere figure ov holmes standing motionless an gazing aftr us. the journey wuz  swift an pleasant one, an i spent it in makin teh moar intimate acquaintance ov mah 2 companions an in playin wif dr. mortimer’s spaniel. in  vary few hourz teh brown earth had become ruddy, teh brick had changd 2 granite, an red cows grazed in well-hedged fields wer teh lush grasses an moar luxuriant vegetation spoke ov  richer, if  damper, climate. young baskerville stared eagerly out ov teh window an cried aloud wif delight as he recognized teh familiar featurez ov teh devon scenery. “i’ve been ovar  gud part ov teh wurld since i left it, dr. watson,” sed he; “but i has nevr seen  place 2 compare wif it.” “i nevr saw  devonshire man hoo did not swear by hims county,” i remarked. “it depends upon teh bred ov men quite as mutch as on teh county,” sed dr. mortimer. “a glance at r frend her revealz teh rounded hed ov teh celt, which carries inside it teh celtic enthusiasm an powr ov attachment. poor sir charles’s hed wuz ov  vary rare type, haf gaelic, haf ivernian in itz characteristics. but u wuz vary young when u last saw baskerville hall, wuz u not?” “i wuz  boi in mah teens at teh tiem ov mah father’s death an had nevr seen teh hall, 4 he lived in  lil cottage on teh south coast. thence i went straight 2  frend in america. i tell u it iz all as nu 2 me as it iz 2 dr. watson, an i’m as keen as posible 2 c teh moor.” “are you? then ur wish iz easily granted, 4 thar iz ur furst sight ov teh moor,” sed dr. mortimer, pointin out ov teh carriage window. over teh green squares ov teh fields an teh low curve ov  wood thar rose in teh distance  grey, melancholy hill, wif  strange jagged summit, dim an vague in teh distance, liek sum fantastic landscape in  dream. baskerville sat 4  long time, hims eyes fixd upon it, an i read upon hims eager face how mutch it meant 2 him, dis furst sight ov dat strange spot wer teh men ov hims blood had held sway so long an left der mark so deep. there he sat, wif hims tweed suit an hims american accent, in teh corner ov  prosaic railway-carriage, an yet as i lookd at hims dark an expressive face i felt moar than evr how true  descendant he wuz ov dat long line ov high-blooded, fiery, an masterful men. there wuz pride, valour, an strength in hims thick brows, hims sensitive nostrils, an hims large hazel eyes. if on dat forbidding moor  difficult an dangerous quest shud lie b4 us, dis wuz at least  comrade 4 whom wan might venture 2 taek  risk wif teh certainty dat he wud bravely share it. the train pulld up at  small wayside stashun an we all descended. outside, beyond teh low, white fence,  wagonette wif  pair ov cobs wuz waiting. our comin wuz evidently  great event, 4 station-master an porters clustered round us 2 carry out r luggage. it wuz  sweet, simple country spot, but i wuz surprisd 2 observe dat by teh gate thar stood 2 soldierly men in dark uniforms hoo leaned upon der short rifles an glanced keenly at us as we passed. the coachman,  hard-faced, gnarled lil fellow, saluted sir henry baskerville, an in  few minutez we wuz flying swiftly down teh broad, white road. rolling pasture lands curved upward on eithr side ov us, an old gabled houses peeped out frum amid teh thick green foliage, but behind teh peaceful an sunlit countryside thar rose ever, dark against teh evening sky, teh long, gloomy curve ov teh moor, brokd by teh jagged an sinister hills. the wagonette swung round into  side road, an we curved upward thru deep lanes worn by centuries ov wheels, high banks on eithr side, heavy wif dripping moss an fleshy hart’s-tongue ferns. bronzing bracken an mottled bramble gleamed in teh light ov teh sinkin sun. still steadily rising, we passed ovar  narrow granite bridge an skirted  noisy stream which gushed swiftly down, foaming an roaring amid teh grey boulders. both road an stream wound up thru  valley dense wif scrub oak an fir. at evry turn baskerville gaev an exclamation ov delight, lukingz eagerly bout him an askin countless questions. to hims eyes all seemd beautiful, but 2 me  tinge ov melancholy lay upon teh countryside, which bore so clearly teh mark ov teh waning year. yellow leaves carpeted teh lanes an fluttered down upon us as we passed. the rattle ov r wheels did away as we drove thru drifts ov rotting vegetation—sad gifts, as it seemd 2 me, 4 nature 2 throw b4 teh carriage ov teh returning heir ov teh baskervilles. “halloa!” cried dr. mortimer, “what iz this?” a steep curve ov heath-clad land, an outlying spur ov teh moor, lay in frunt ov us. on teh summit, hard an clear liek an equestrian statue upon itz pedestal, wuz  mounted soldier, dark an stern, hims rifle poised ready ovar hims forearm. he wuz watchin teh road along which we travelled. “what iz this, perkins?” askd dr. mortimer. our driver haf turnd in hims seat. “there’s  convict escaped frum princetown, sir. he’s been out 3 dais now, an teh warders watch evry road an evry station, but they’ve had no sight ov him yet. the farmers bout her don’t liek it, sir, an that’s  fact.” “well, i understand dat they git five pounds if they can giv information.” “yes, sir, but teh chance ov five pounds iz but  poor ting compared 2 teh chance ov havin ur throat cut. you see, it isn’t liek any ordinary convict. this iz  man dat wud stick at nothing.” “who iz he, then?” “it iz selden, teh notting hill murderer.” i remembered teh case well, 4 it wuz wan in which holmes had taken an interest on akownt ov teh peculiar ferocity ov teh crime an teh wanton brutality which had marked all teh akshuns ov teh assassin. the commutation ov hims death sentence had been due 2 sum doubts as 2 hims complete sanity, so atrocious wuz hims conduct. our wagonette had topped  rise an in frunt ov us rose teh huge expanse ov teh moor, mottled wif gnarled an craggy cairns an tors. a cold wind swept down frum it an set us shivering. somewhere there, on dat desolate plain, wuz lurking dis fiendish man, hiding in  burrow liek  wild beast, hims heart fol ov malignancy against teh whole race which had cast him out. it needd but dis 2 complete teh grim suggestiveness ov teh barren waste, teh chilling wind, an teh darkling sky. even baskerville fell silent an pulld hims overcoat moar closely around him. we had left teh fertile country behind an beneath us. we lookd bak on it now, teh slanting rays ov  low sun turning teh streams 2 threads ov gold an glowing on teh red earth nu turnd by teh plough an teh broad tangle ov teh woodlands. the road in frunt ov us grew bleaker an wilder ovar huge russet an olive slopes, sprinkled wif hooj boulders. now an then we passed  moorland cottage, walled an roofed wif stone, wif no creeper 2 break itz harsh outline. suddenly we lookd down into  cuplike depression, patched wif stunted oaks an firs which had been twisted an bent by teh fury ov yeers ov storm. two high, narrow towers rose ovar teh trees. the driver pointed wif hims whip. “baskerville hall,” sed he. its master had risen an wuz staring wif flushed cheeks an shining eyes. a few minutez latr we had reachd teh lodge-gates,  maze ov fantastic tracery in wrought iron, wif weather-bitten pillars on eithr side, blotched wif lichens, an surmounted by teh boars’ headz ov teh baskervilles. the lodge wuz  ruin ov black granite an bared ribs ov rafters, but facing it wuz  nu building, haf constructed, teh furst fruit ov sir charles’s south african gold. through teh gateway we passed into teh avenue, wer teh wheels wuz again hushed amid teh leaves, an teh old trees shot der branches in  sombre tunnel ovar r heads. baskerville shuddered as he lookd up teh long, dark driv 2 wer teh houz glimmered liek  ghost at teh farther end. “was it here?” he askd in  low voice. “no, no, teh yew alley iz on teh othr side.” the young heir glanced round wif  gloomy face. “it’s no wondr mah uncle felt as if trouble wuz comin on him in such  place as this,” sed he. “it’s enough 2 scare any man. i’ll has  row ov electric lamps up her inside ov 6 months, an u won’t knoe it again, wif  thousand candle-power swan an edison rite her in frunt ov teh hall door.” the avenue opened into  broad expanse ov turf, an teh houz lay b4 us. in teh fading light i cud c dat teh centre wuz  heavy block ov buildin frum which  porch projected. the whole frunt wuz draped in ivy, wif  patch clipped bare her an thar wer  window or  coat ov arms broke thru teh dark veil. from dis central block rose teh twin towers, ancient, crenelated, an pierced wif lotz da loopholes. to rite an left ov teh turrets wuz moar modern wings ov black granite. a dull light shone thru heavy mullioned windows, an frum teh high chimneys which rose frum teh steep, high-angled roof thar sprang  single black column ov smoke. “welcome, sir henry! welcome 2 baskerville hall!” a tall man had steppd frum teh shadow ov teh porch 2 open teh door ov teh wagonette. the figure ov  woman wuz silhouetted against teh yellow light ov teh hall. she came out an helpd teh man 2 hand down r bags. “you don’t mind mah drivin straight home, sir henry?” sed dr. mortimer. “my wife iz expecting me.” “surely u will stay an has sum dinner?” “no, i must go. i shall probably find sum werk awaiting me. i wud stay 2 show u ovar teh house, but barrymore will bees  bettr guide than i. good-bye, an nevr hesitate night or dai 2 send 4 me if i can bees ov service.” the wheels did away down teh driv while sir henry an i turnd into teh hall, an teh door clanged heavily behind us. it wuz  fine apartment in which we findz ourselves, large, lofty, an heavily raftered wif huge baulks ov age-blackened oak. in teh great old-fashioned fireplace behind teh high iron dogs  log-fire crackled an snapped. sir henry an i held out r hanz 2 it, 4 we wuz numb frum r long drive. then we gazed round us at teh high, thin window ov old stained glass, teh oak panelling, teh stags’ heads, teh coats ov arms upon teh walls, all dim an sombre in teh subdued light ov teh central lamp. “it’s jus as i imagined it,” sed sir henry. “is it not teh vary picture ov an old family home? to finks dat dis shud bees teh same hall in which 4 five hundrd yeers mah peeps has lived. it strikez me solemn 2 finks ov it.” i saw hims dark face lit up wif  boyish enthusiasm as he gazed bout him. the light beat upon him wer he stood, but long shadows trailed down teh walls an hung liek  black canopy above him. barrymore had returned frum takin r luggage 2 r rooms. he stood in frunt ov us nao wif teh subdued manner ov  well-trained servant. he wuz  remarkable-looking man, tall, handsome, wif  square black beard an pale, distinguished features. “would u wish dinnr 2 bees servd at once, sir?” “is it ready?” “in  vary few minutes, sir. you will find hot water in ur rooms. my wife an i will bees happy, sir henry, 2 stay wif u til u has made ur fresh arrangements, but u will understand dat undr teh nu condishuns dis houz will require  considerable staff.” “what nu conditions?” “i only meant, sir, dat sir charles led  vary retired life, an we wuz able 2 look aftr hims wants. you would, naturally, wish 2 has moar company, an so u will ned changez in ur household.” “do u mean dat ur wife an u wish 2 leave?” “only when it iz quite convenient 2 you, sir.” “but ur family has been wif us 4 several generations, has they not? i shud bees sry 2 begin mah life her by breaking an old family connection.” i seemd 2 discern sum signz ov emotion upon teh butler’s white face. “i feelz dat also, sir, an so doez mah wife. but 2 tell teh truth, sir, we wuz both vary mutch attachd 2 sir charles, an hims death gaev us  shock an made thees surroundings vary painful 2 us. i fear dat we shall nevr again bees easy in r mindz at baskerville hall.” “but wut doez u intend 2 do?” “i has no doubt, sir, dat we shall succed in establishin ourselves in sum business. sir charles’s generosity has given us teh meanz 2 doez so. and now, sir, perhapz i had best show u 2 ur rooms.” a square balustraded gallery ran round teh top ov teh old hall, approached by  double stair. from dis central point 2 long corridors extended teh whole length ov teh building, frum which all teh bedrooms opened. my own wuz in teh same wing as baskerville’s an almost next door 2 it. these rooms appeard 2 bees mutch moar modern than teh central part ov teh house, an teh bright papr an numerous candles did somethin 2 remove teh sombre impression which r arrival had left upon mah mind. but teh dining-room which opened out ov teh hall wuz  place ov shadow an gloom. it wuz  long chamber wif  step separating teh dais wer teh family sat frum teh lower porshun reserved 4 der dependents. at wan end  minstrel’s gallery overlookd it. black beams shot acros above r heads, wif  smoke-darkened ceiling beyond them. with rowz ov flaring torches 2 light it up, an teh colour an rude hilarity ov an old-time banquet, it might has softened; but now, when 2 black-clothed gentlemen sat in teh lil circle ov light thrown by  shaded lamp, one’s voice became hushed an one’s spirit subdued. a dim line ov ancestors, in evry variety ov dress, frum teh elizabethan knight 2 teh buck ov teh regency, stared down upon us an daunted us by der silent company. we talkd little, an i 4 wan wuz glad when teh meal wuz ovar an we wuz able 2 retire into teh modern billiard-room an smoke  cigarette. “my word, it isn’t  vary cheerful place,” sed sir henry. “i suppose wan can tone down 2 it, but i feelz  bit out ov teh picture at present. i don’t wondr dat mah uncle got  lil jumpy if he lived all alone in such  houz as this. however, if it suits you, we will retire early tonight, an perhapz tings cud seem moar cheerful in teh morning.” i drew aside mah curtains b4 i went 2 bed an lookd out frum mah window. it opened upon teh grassy space which lay in frunt ov teh hall door. beyond, 2 copses ov trees moaned an swung in  rising wind. a haf moon broke thru teh rifts ov racing clouds. in itz cold light i saw beyond teh trees  brokd fringe ov rocks, an teh long, low curve ov teh melancholy moor. i closed teh curtain, feelin dat mah last impression wuz in keepin wif teh rest. and yet it wuz not quite teh last. i findz myself weary an yet wakeful, tossing restlessly frum side 2 side, seekin 4 teh sleep which wud not come. far away  chiming clock struck out teh quarterz ov teh hours, but otherwize  deathly silence lay upon teh old house. and then suddenly, in teh vary ded ov teh night, thar came  sound 2 mah ears, clear, resonant, an unmistakable. it wuz teh sob ov  woman, teh muffled, strangling gasp ov wan hoo iz torn by an uncontrollable sorrow. i sat up in bed an listend intently. the noise cud not has been far away an wuz certainly in teh house. for haf an hour i waited wif evry nerve on teh alert, but thar came no othr sound save teh chiming clock an teh rustle ov teh ivy on teh wall. chapter 7. the stapletons ov merripit house the fresh beauty ov teh followin mornin did somethin 2 efface frum r mindz teh grim an grey impression which had been left upon both ov us by r furst experience ov baskerville hall. as sir henry an i sat at breakfast teh sunlight flooded in thru teh high mullioned windows, throwin watery patches ov colour frum teh coats ov arms which covered them. the dark panelling glowed liek bronze in teh golden rays, an it wuz hard 2 realise dat dis wuz inded teh chamber which had struck such  gloom into r souls upon teh evening before. “i gues it iz ourselves an not teh houz dat we has 2 blame!” sed teh baronet. “we wuz tired wif r journey an chilled by r drive, so we took  grey view ov teh place. now we r fresh an well, so it iz all cheerful once more.” “and yet it wuz not entirely  queshun ov imagination,” i answered. “did you, 4 example, happen 2 hear someone,  woman i think, sobbing in teh night?” “that iz curious, 4 i did when i wuz haf asleep fancy dat i herd somethin ov teh sort. i waited quite  time, but thar wuz no moar ov it, so i concludd dat it wuz all  dream.” “i herd it distinctly, an i am sure dat it wuz rly teh sob ov  woman.” “we must ask bout dis rite away.” he rang teh bell an askd barrymore whethr he cud akownt 4 r experience. it seemd 2 me dat teh pallid featurez ov teh butler turnd  shade paler still as he listend 2 hims master’s question. “there r only 2 women in teh house, sir henry,” he answered. “one iz teh scullery-maid, hoo sleeps in teh othr wing. the othr iz mah wife, an i can anzwr 4 it dat teh sound cud not has come frum her.” and yet he lied as he sed it, 4 it chanced dat aftr breakfast i met mrs. barrymore in teh long corridor wif teh sun fol upon her face. she wuz  large, impassive, heavy-featured woman wif  stern set expreshun ov mouth. but her telltale eyes wuz red an glanced at me frum tween swollen lids. it wuz she, then, hoo wept in teh night, an if she did so her husband must knoe it. yet he had taken teh obvious risk ov discovery in declaring dat it wuz not so. why had he dun this? and y did she weep so bitterly? already round dis pale-faced, handsome, black-bearded man thar wuz gathering an atmosphere ov mystery an ov gloom. it wuz he hoo had been teh furst 2 discover teh body ov sir charles, an we had only hims werd 4 all teh circumstances which led up 2 teh old man’s death. was it posible dat it wuz barrymore, aftr all, whom we had seen in teh cab in regent street? the beard might well has been teh same. the cabman had describd  somewhat shortr man, but such an impression might easily has been erroneous. how cud i settle teh point forever? obviously teh furst ting 2 doez wuz 2 c teh grimpen postmaster an find whethr teh test telegram had rly been placed in barrymore’s own hands. be teh anzwr wut it might, i shud at least has somethin 2 report 2 sherlock holmes. sir henry had numerous papers 2 examine aftr breakfast, so dat teh tiem wuz propitious 4 mah excursion. it wuz  pleasant walk ov 4 miles along teh edge ov teh moor, leadin me at last 2  small grey hamlet, in which 2 largr buildings, which proved 2 bees teh inn an teh houz ov dr. mortimer, stood high above teh rest. the postmaster, hoo wuz also teh village grocer, had  clear recollection ov teh telegram. “certainly, sir,” sed he, “i had teh telegram deliverd 2 mr. barrymore egsaktly as directed.” “who deliverd it?” “my boi here. james, u deliverd dat telegram 2 mr. barrymore at teh hall last week, did u not?” “yes, father, i deliverd it.” “into hims own hands?” i asked. “well, he wuz up in teh loft at teh time, so dat i cud not put it into hims own hands, but i gaev it into mrs. barrymore’s hands, an she promised 2 delivr it at once.” “did u c mr. barrymore?” “no, sir; i tell u he wuz in teh loft.” “if u didn’t c him, how doez u knoe he wuz in teh loft?” “well, surely hims own wife ought 2 knoe wer he is,” sed teh postmaster testily. “didn’t he git teh telegram? if thar iz any mistake it iz 4 mr. barrymore him 2 complain.” it seemd hopeless 2 pursue teh inquiry any farther, but it wuz clear dat in spite ov holmes’s ruse we had no proof dat barrymore had not been in london all teh time. suppose dat it wuz so—suppose dat teh same man had been teh last hoo had seen sir charles alive, an teh furst 2 dog teh nu heir when he returned 2 england. what then? was he teh agent ov otherz or had he sum sinister design ov hims own? what interest cud he has in persecuting teh baskerville family? i thot ov teh strange warning clipped out ov teh leadin article ov teh _times_. was dat hims werk or wuz it possibly teh doin ov someone hoo wuz bent upon counteracting hims schemes? the only conceivable motive wuz dat which had been suggestd by sir henry, dat if teh family cud bees skerd away  comfortable an permanent home wud bees secured 4 teh barrymores. but surely such an explanashun as dat wud bees quite inadequate 2 akownt 4 teh deep an subtle scheming which seemd 2 bees weaving an invisible net round teh young baronet. holmes him had sed dat no moar complex case had come 2 him in all teh long seriez ov hims sensational investigations. i prayed, as i walked bak along teh grey, lonely road, dat mah frend might soon bees freed frum hims preoccupations an able 2 come down 2 taek dis heavy burden ov responsibility frum mah shoulders. suddenly mah thoughtz wuz interrupted by teh sound ov runnin feet behind me an by  voice which calld me by name. i turned, expecting 2 c dr. mortimer, but 2 mah surprise it wuz  stranger hoo wuz pursuin me. he wuz  small, slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired an lean-jawed, tween thirty an forty yeers ov age, dressd in  grey suit an wearin  straw hat. a tin box 4 botanical specimens hung ovar hims shoulder an he carried  green butterfly-net in wan ov hims hands. “you will, i am sure, excuse mah presumption, dr. watson,” sed he as he came panting up 2 wer i stood. “here on teh moor we r homely folk an doez not wait 4 formal introductions. you cud possibly has herd mah naym frum r mutual friend, mortimer. i am stapleton, ov merripit house.” “your net an box wud has told me as much,” sed i, “for i knew dat mr. stapleton wuz  naturalist. but how did u knoe me?” “i has been callin on mortimer, an he pointed u out 2 me frum teh window ov hims surgery as u passed. as r road lay teh same wai i thot dat i wud overtake u an introduce myself. i trust dat sir henry iz none teh worse 4 hims journey?” “he iz vary well, thank you.” “we wuz all rathr afraid dat aftr teh sad death ov sir charles teh nu baronet might refuse 2 liv here. it iz askin mutch ov  wealthy man 2 come down an bury him in  place ov dis kind, but i ned not tell u dat it meanz  vary great deal 2 teh countryside. sir henry has, i suppose, no superstitious fears in teh matter?” “i doez not finks dat it iz likely.” “of course u knoe teh legend ov teh fiend dog which haunts teh family?” “i has herd it.” “it iz extraordinary how credulous teh peasants r bout here! any numbr ov them r ready 2 swear dat they has seen such  creature upon teh moor.” he spoke wif  smile, but i seemd 2 read in hims eyes dat he took teh mattr moar seriously. “the story took  great hold upon teh imagination ov sir charles, an i has no doubt dat it led 2 hims tragic end.” “but how?” “his nerves wuz so werkd up dat teh appearance ov any dog might has had  fatal effect upon hims diseased heart. i fancy dat he rly did c somethin ov teh kind upon dat last night in teh yew alley. i feared dat sum disaster might occur, 4 i wuz vary fond ov teh old man, an i knew dat hims heart wuz weak.” “how did u knoe that?” “my frend mortimer told me.” “you think, then, dat sum dog pursued sir charles, an dat he did ov fright in consequence?” “have u any bettr explanation?” “i has not come 2 any conclusion.” “has mr. sherlock holmes?” the werdz took away mah breath 4 an instant but  glance at teh placid face an steadfast eyes ov mah companion showd dat no surprise wuz intended. “it iz useles 4 us 2 pretend dat we doez not knoe you, dr. watson,” sed he. “the records ov ur detective has reachd us here, an u cud not celebrate him without bein known yourself. when mortimer told me ur naym he cud not deny ur identity. if u r here, then it follows dat mr. sherlock holmes iz interestin him in teh matter, an i am naturally curious 2 knoe wut view he cud take.” “i am afraid dat i cannot anzwr dat question.” “may i ask if he iz goin 2 honour us wif  visit himself?” “he cannot leef town at present. he has othr cases which engage hims attention.” “what  pity! he might throw sum light on dat which iz so dark 2 us. but as 2 ur own researches, if thar iz any posible wai in which i can bees ov survis 2 u i trust dat u will command me. if i had any indication ov teh nachur ov ur suspicions or how u propose 2 investigate teh case, i might perhapz even nao giv u sum aid or advice.” “i assure u dat i am simply her upon  visit 2 mah friend, sir henry, an dat i ned no halp ov any kind.” “excellent!” sed stapleton. “you r perfectly rite 2 bees wary an discreet. i am justly reproved 4 wut i feelz wuz an unjustifiable intrusion, an i promise u dat i will not menshun teh mattr again.” we had come 2  point wer  narrow grassy path struck off frum teh road an wound away acros teh moor. a steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon teh rite which had in bygone dais been cut into  granite quarry. the face which wuz turnd towardz us formd  dark cliff, wif ferns an brambles growin in itz niches. from ovar  distant rise thar floated  grey plume ov smoke. “a moderate walk along dis moor-path bringz us 2 merripit house,” sed he. “perhaps u will spare an hour dat i cud has teh pleasure ov introducin u 2 mah sister.” my furst thot wuz dat i shud bees by sir henry’s side. but then i remembered teh pile ov papers an bills wif which hims study table wuz littered. it wuz certain dat i cud not halp wif those. and holmes had expressly sed dat i shud study teh neighbours upon teh moor. i accepted stapleton’s invitation, an we turnd togehtr down teh path. “it iz  wonderful place, teh moor,” sed he, lukingz round ovar teh undulating downs, long green rollers, wif crests ov jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges. “you nevr tire ov teh moor. you cannot finks teh wonderful seekretz which it contains. it iz so vast, an so barren, an so mysterious.” “you knoe it well, then?” “i has only been her 2 years. the residentz wud call me  newcomer. we came shortly aftr sir charles settled. but mah tastes led me 2 explore evry part ov teh country round, an i shud finks dat thar r few men hoo knoe it bettr than i do.” “is it hard 2 know?” “very hard. you see, 4 example, dis great plain 2 teh north her wif teh queer hills breaking out ov it. do u observe anythin remarkable bout that?” “it wud bees  rare place 4  gallop.” “you wud naturally finks so an teh thot has cost several der lives b4 now. you notice dose bright green spots scattered thickly ovar it?” “yes, they seem moar fertile than teh rest.” stapleton laughed. “that iz teh great grimpen mire,” sed he. “a false step yonder meanz death 2 man or beast. only yesterdai i saw wan ov teh moor ponies wander into it. he nevr came out. i saw hims hed 4 quite  long tiem craning out ov teh bog-hole, but it sucked him down at last. even in dry seasons it iz  dangr 2 cross it, but aftr thees autumn rains it iz an awful place. and yet i can find mah wai 2 teh vary heart ov it an return alive. by george, thar iz anothr ov dose miserable ponies!” something brown wuz rollin an tossing among teh green sedges. then  long, agonised, writhing neck shot upward an  dreadful cry echoed ovar teh moor. it turnd me cold wif horror, but mah companion’s nerves seemd 2 bees strongr than mine. “it’s gone!” sed he. “the mire has him. two in 2 days, an lotz da more, perhaps, 4 they git in teh wai ov goin thar in teh dry weathr an nevr knoe teh difference til teh mire has them in itz clutches. it’s  bad place, teh great grimpen mire.” “and u sai u can penetrate it?” “yes, thar r wan or 2 paths which  vary active man can take. i has findz them out.” “but y shud u wish 2 go into so horrible  place?” “well, u c teh hills beyond? they r rly islands cut off on all sides by teh impassable mire, which has crawled round them in teh course ov years. that iz wer teh rare plants an teh butterflies are, if u has teh wit 2 reach them.” “i shall try mah luck sum day.” he lookd at me wif  surprisd face. “for god’s sake put such an idea out ov ur mind,” sed he. “your blood wud bees upon mah head. i assure u dat thar wud not bees teh least chance ov ur comin bak alive. it iz only by remembering certain complex landmarks dat i am able 2 doez it.” “halloa!” i cried. “what iz that?” a long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept ovar teh moor. it filled teh whole air, an yet it wuz impossible 2 sai whence it came. from  dull murmur it swelld into  deep roar, an then sank bak into  melancholy, throbbing murmur once again. stapleton lookd at me wif  curious expreshun in hims face. “queer place, teh moor!” sed he. “but wut iz it?” “the peasants sai it iz teh hound ov teh baskervilles callin 4 itz prey. i’ve herd it once or twice before, but nevr quite so loud.” i lookd round, wif  chill ov fear in mah heart, at teh huge swelling plain, mottled wif teh green patches ov rushes. nothing stirred ovar teh vast expanse save  pair ov ravens, which croaked loudly frum  tor behind us. “you r an educated man. you don’t bleev such nonsense as that?” sed i. “what doez u finks iz teh cause ov so strange  sound?” “bogs mak queer noises sometimes. it’s teh mud settling, or teh water rising, or something.” “no, no, dat wuz  livin voice.” “well, perhapz it was. did u evr hear  bittern booming?” “no, i nevr did.” “it’s  vary rare bird—practically extinct—in england now, but all tings r posible upon teh moor. yes, i shud not bees surprisd 2 learn dat wut we has herd iz teh cry ov teh last ov teh bitterns.” “it’s teh weirdest, strangest ting dat evr i herd in mah life.” “yes, it’s rathr an uncanny place altogether. look at teh hillside yonder. what doez u mak ov those?” the whole steep slope wuz covered wif grey circular rings ov stone,  skor ov them at least. “what r they? sheep-pens?” “no, they r teh homes ov r worthy ancestors. prehistoric man lived thickly on teh moor, an as no wan in particular has lived thar since, we find all hims lil arrangements egsaktly as he left them. these r hims wigwams wif teh roofs off. you can even c hims hearth an hims couch if u has teh curiosity 2 go inside. “but it iz quite  town. when wuz it inhabited?” “neolithic man—no date.” “what did he do?” “he grazed hims cattle on thees slopes, an he learnd 2 dig 4 tin when teh bronze sword began 2 supersede teh stone axe. look at teh great trench in teh opposite hill. that iz hims mark. yes, u will find sum vary singular pointz bout teh moor, dr. watson. oh, excuse me an instant! it iz surely cyclopides.” a small fly or moth had fluttered acros r path, an in an instant stapleton wuz rushing wif extraordinary energy an sped in pursuit ov it. to mah dismay teh creature flew straight 4 teh great mire, an mah acquaintance nevr paused 4 an instant, bounding frum tuft 2 tuft behind it, hims green net waving in teh air. his grey clothes an jerky, zigzag, irregular progres made him not unlike sum huge moth himself. i wuz standing watchin hims pursuit wif  mixture ov admiration 4 hims extraordinary activity an fear lest he shud lose hims footing in teh treacherous mire, when i herd teh sound ov stepz and, turning round, findz  woman near me upon teh path. she had come frum teh direcshun in which teh plume ov smoke indicatd teh posishun ov merripit house, but teh dip ov teh moor had hid her til she wuz quite close. i cud not doubt dat dis wuz teh miss stapleton ov whom i had been told, since ladiez ov any sort must bees few upon teh moor, an i remembered dat i had herd someone describe her as bein  beauty. the woman hoo approached me wuz certainly that, an ov  most uncommon type. there cud not has been  greatr contrast tween brother an sister, 4 stapleton wuz neutral tinted, wif light hair an grey eyes, while she wuz darker than any brunette whom i has seen in england—slim, elegant, an tall. she had  proud, finely cut face, so regular dat it might has seemd impassive wuz it not 4 teh sensitive mouth an teh beautiful dark, eager eyes. with her perfik figure an elegant dress she was, indeed,  strange apparition upon  lonely moorland path. her eyes wuz on her brother as i turned, an then she quickened her pace towardz me. i had raisd mah hat an wuz bout 2 mak sum explanatory remark when her own werdz turnd all mah thoughtz into  nu channel. “go back!” she said. “go straight bak 2 london, instantly.” i cud only stare at her in stupid surprise. her eyes blazed at me, an she tapped teh ground impatiently wif her foot. “why shud i go back?” i asked. “i cannot explain.” she spoke in  low, eager voice, wif  curious lisp in her utterance. “but 4 god’s sake doez wut i ask you. go bak an nevr set foot upon teh moor again.” “but i has only jus come.” “man, man!” she cried. “can u not tell when  warning iz 4 ur own good? go bak 2 london! start tonight! get away frum dis place at all costs! hush, mah brother iz coming! not  werd ov wut i has said. would u mind gettin dat orchid 4 me among teh mare’s-tails yonder? we r vary rich in orchids on teh moor, though, ov course, u r rathr late 2 c teh beauties ov teh place.” stapleton had abandoned teh chase an came bak 2 us breathing hard an flushed wif hims exertions. “halloa, beryl!” sed he, an it seemd 2 me dat teh tone ov hims greeting wuz not altogether  cordial one. “well, jack, u r vary hot.” “yes, i wuz chasing  cyclopides. he iz vary rare an seldom findz in teh late autumn. what  pity dat i shud has misd him!” he spoke unconcernedly, but hims small light eyes glanced incessantly frum teh gurl 2 me. “you has introducd yourselves, i can see.” “yes. i wuz tellin sir henry dat it wuz rathr late 4 him 2 c teh true beauties ov teh moor.” “why, hoo doez u finks dis is?” “i imagine dat it must bees sir henry baskerville.” “no, no,” sed i. “only  humble commoner, but hims friend. my naym iz dr. watson.” a flush ov vexation passed ovar her expressive face. “we has been talkin at cross purposes,” sed she. “why, u had not vary mutch tiem 4 talk,” her brother remarked wif teh same questioning eyes. “i talkd as if dr. watson wuz  resident instead ov bein merely  visitor,” sed she. “it cannot mutch mattr 2 him whethr it iz early or late 4 teh orchids. but u will come on, will u not, an c merripit house?” a short walk brought us 2 it,  bleak moorland house, once teh farm ov sum grazier in teh old prosperous days, but nao put into repair an turnd into  modern dwelling. an orchard surrounded it, but teh trees, as iz usual upon teh moor, wuz stunted an nipped, an teh effect ov teh whole place wuz mean an melancholy. we wuz admittd by  strange, wizened, rusty-coated old manservant, hoo seemd in keepin wif teh house. inside, however, thar wuz large rooms furnishd wif an elegance in which i seemd 2 recognize teh taste ov teh lady. as i lookd frum der windowz at teh interminable granite-flecked moor rollin unbroken 2 teh farthest horizon i cud not but marvel at wut cud has brought dis highly educated man an dis beautiful woman 2 liv in such  place. “queer spot 2 choose, iz it not?” sed he as if in anzwr 2 mah thought. “and yet we manage 2 mak ourselves fairly happy, doez we not, beryl?” “quite happy,” sed she, but thar wuz no ring ov conviction in her words. “i had  school,” sed stapleton. “it wuz in teh north country. the werk 2  man ov mah temperament wuz mechanical an uninteresting, but teh privilege ov livin wif youth, ov helpin 2 mould dose young minds, an ov impressing them wif one’s own character an ideals wuz vary dear 2 me. however, teh fates wuz against us. a serious epidemic broke out in teh school an 3 ov teh boys died. it nevr recovered frum teh blow, an mutch ov mah capital wuz irretrievably swallowed up. and yet, if it wuz not 4 teh loss ov teh charming companionship ov teh boys, i cud rejoice ovar mah own misfortune, for, wif mah strong tastes 4 botany an zoology, i find an unlimited field ov werk here, an mah sister iz as devoted 2 nature as i am. all this, dr. watson, has been brought upon ur hed by ur expreshun as u surveyed teh moor out ov r window.” “it certainly did cross mah mind dat it might bees  lil dull—less 4 you, perhaps, than 4 ur sister.” “no, no, i am nevr dull,” sed she quickly. “we has books, we has r studies, an we has interestin neighbours. dr. mortimer iz  most learnd man in hims own line. poor sir charles wuz also an admirable companion. we knew him well an mis him moar than i can tell. do u finks dat i shud intrude if i wuz 2 call dis afternoon an mak teh acquaintance ov sir henry?” “i am sure dat he wud bees delighted.” “then perhapz u wud menshun dat i propose 2 doez so. we cud in r humble wai doez somethin 2 mak tings moar easy 4 him til he becomez accustomd 2 hims nu surroundings. will u come upstairs, dr. watson, an inspect mah collecshun ov lepidoptera? i finks it iz teh most complete wan in teh south-west ov england. by teh tiem dat u has lookd thru them lunch will bees almost ready.” but i wuz eager 2 git bak 2 mah charge. the melancholy ov teh moor, teh death ov teh unfortunate pony, teh weird sound which had been associatd wif teh grim legend ov teh baskervilles, all thees tings tinged mah thoughtz wif sadness. then on teh top ov thees moar or les vague impreshuns thar had come teh definite an distinct warning ov miss stapleton, deliverd wif such intense earnestness dat i cud not doubt dat sum grave an deep reason lay behind it. i resisted all pressure 2 stay 4 lunch, an i set off at once upon mah return journey, takin teh grass-grown path by which we had come. it seems, however, dat thar must has been sum short cut 4 dose hoo knew it, 4 b4 i had reachd teh road i wuz astounded 2 c miss stapleton sitting upon  rock by teh side ov teh track. her face wuz beautifully flushed wif her exertions an she held her hand 2 her side. “i has run all teh wai in ordr 2 cut u off, dr. watson,” sed she. “i had not even tiem 2 put on mah hat. i must not stop, or mah brother cud mis me. i wantd 2 sai 2 u how sry i am bout teh stupid mistake i made in thinkin dat u wuz sir henry. please forget teh werdz i said, which has no applicashun whatevr 2 you.” “but i can’t forget them, miss stapleton,” sed i. “i am sir henry’s friend, an hims welfare iz  vary close concern ov mine. tell me y it wuz dat u wuz so eager dat sir henry shud return 2 london.” “a woman’s whim, dr. watson. when u knoe me bettr u will understand dat i cannot alwayz giv reasonz 4 wut i sai or do.” “no, no. i remembr teh thrill in ur voice. i remembr teh look in ur eyes. please, please, bees frank wif me, miss stapleton, 4 evr since i has been her i has been conscious ov shadows all round me. life has become liek dat great grimpen mire, wif lil green patches everywhere into which wan cud sink an wif no guide 2 point teh track. tell me then wut it wuz dat u meant, an i will promise 2 convey ur warning 2 sir henry.” an expreshun ov irresolution passed 4 an instant ovar her face, but her eyes had hardened again when she anzwerd me. “you mak 2 mutch ov it, dr. watson,” sed she. “my brother an i wuz vary mutch shocked by teh death ov sir charles. we knew him vary intimately, 4 hims favourite walk wuz ovar teh moor 2 r house. he wuz deeply impresd wif teh curse which hung ovar teh family, an when dis tragedy came i naturally felt dat thar must bees sum groundz 4 teh fears which he had expressed. i wuz distressed therefore when anothr membr ov teh family came down 2 liv here, an i felt dat he shud bees warnd ov teh dangr which he will run. that wuz all which i intendd 2 convey. “but wut iz teh danger?” “you knoe teh story ov teh hound?” “i doez not bleev in such nonsense.” “but i do. if u has any influence wif sir henry, taek him away frum  place which has alwayz been fatal 2 hims family. the wurld iz wide. why shud he wish 2 liv at teh place ov danger?” “because it _is_ teh place ov danger. that iz sir henry’s nature. i fear dat unles u can giv me sum moar definite informashun than dis it wud bees impossible 2 git him 2 move.” “i cannot sai anythin definite, 4 i doez not knoe anythin definite.” “i wud ask u wan moar question, miss stapleton. if u meant no moar than dis when u furst spoke 2 me, y shud u not wish ur brother 2 overhear wut u said? there iz nothin 2 which he, or anyone else, cud object.” “my brother iz vary anxious 2 has teh hall inhabited, 4 he thinks it iz 4 teh gud ov teh poor folk upon teh moor. he wud bees vary angry if he knew dat i has sed anythin which might induce sir henry 2 go away. but i has dun mah duty nao an i will sai no more. i must go back, or he will mis me an suspect dat i has seen you. good-bye!” she turnd an had disappeared in  few minutez among teh scattered boulders, while i, wif mah soul fol ov vague fears, pursued mah wai 2 baskerville hall. chapter 8. first report ov dr. watson from dis point onward i will follow teh course ov eventz by transcribing mah own letterz 2 mr. sherlock holmes which lie b4 me on teh table. one paeg iz missing, but otherwize they r egsaktly as writteh an show mah feelings an suspicions ov teh moment moar accurately than mah memory, clear as it iz upon thees tragic events, can possibly do. baskerville hall, october 13th. my dear holmes, my previous letterz an telegrams has kept u pritee well up 2 date as 2 all dat has occurred in dis most god-forsaken corner ov teh world. the longr wan stayz her teh moar doez teh spirit ov teh moor sink into one’s soul, itz vastness, an also itz grim charm. when u r once out upon itz bosom u has left all traces ov modern england behind you, but, on teh othr hand, u r conscious everywhere ov teh homes an teh werk ov teh prehistoric people. on all sides ov u as u walk r teh houses ov thees forgotten folk, wif der graves an teh huge monoliths which r supposd 2 has marked der temples. as u look at der grey stone huts against teh scarred hillsides u leef ur own age behind you, an if u wuz 2 c  skin-clad, hairy man crawl out frum teh low door fitting  flint-tipped arrow on 2 teh strin ov hims bow, u wud feelz dat hims presence thar wuz moar natural than ur own. the strange ting iz dat they shud has lived so thickly on wut must alwayz has been most unfruitful soil. i am no antiquarian, but i cud imagine dat they wuz sum unwarlike an harried race hoo wuz forcd 2 accept dat which none othr wud occupy. all this, however, iz foreign 2 teh mishun on which u sent me an will probably bees vary uninteresting 2 ur severely practical mind. i can still remembr ur complete indifference as 2 whethr teh sun movd round teh earth or teh earth round teh sun. let me, therefore, return 2 teh facts concerning sir henry baskerville. if u has not had any report within teh last few dais it iz cuz up 2 todai thar wuz nothin ov importance 2 relate. then  vary surprisn circumstance occurred, which i shall tell u in due course. but, furst ov all, i must keep u in touch wif sum ov teh othr factorz in teh situation. one ov these, concerning which i has sed little, iz teh escaped convict upon teh moor. there iz strong reason nao 2 bleev dat he has got rite away, which iz  considerable relief 2 teh lonely householders ov dis district. a fortnight has passed since hims flight, durin which he has not been seen an nothin has been herd ov him. it iz surely inconceivable dat he cud has held out upon teh moor durin all dat time. of course, so far as hims concealment goez thar iz no difficulty at all. any wan ov thees stone huts wud giv him  hiding-place. but thar iz nothin 2 eat unles he wuz 2 catch an slaughter wan ov teh moor sheep. we think, therefore, dat he has gone, an teh outlying farmers sleep teh bettr in consequence. we r 4 able-bodied men in dis household, so dat we cud taek gud care ov ourselves, but i confess dat i has had uneasy moments when i has thot ov teh stapletons. they liv miles frum any help. there r wan maid, an old manservant, teh sister, an teh brother, teh lattr not  vary strong man. they wud bees helpless in teh hanz ov  desperate fellow liek dis notting hill criminal if he cud once effect an entrance. both sir henry an i wuz concerned at der situation, an it wuz suggestd dat perkins teh groom shud go ovar 2 sleep there, but stapleton wud not hear ov it. the fact iz dat r friend, teh baronet, begins 2 display  considerable interest in r fair neighbour. it iz not 2 bees wondered at, 4 tiem hangs heavily in dis lonely spot 2 an active man liek him, an she iz  vary fascintatin an beautiful woman. there iz somethin tropical an exotic bout her which formz  singular contrast 2 her cool an unemotional brother. yet he also givez teh idea ov hidden fires. he has certainly  vary marked influence ovar her, 4 i has seen her continually glance at him as she talkd as if seekin approbation 4 wut she said. i trust dat he iz kind 2 her. there iz  dry glitter in hims eyes an  firm set ov hims thin lips, which goez wif  positiv an possibly  harsh nature. you wud find him an interestin study. he came ovar 2 call upon baskerville on dat furst day, an teh vary next mornin he took us both 2 show us teh spot wer teh legend ov teh wicked hugo iz supposd 2 has had itz origin. it wuz an excursion ov sum miles acros teh moor 2  place which iz so dismal dat it might has suggestd teh story. we findz  short valley tween ruggd tors which led 2 an open, grassy space flecked ovar wif teh white cotton grass. in teh middle ov it rose 2 great stones, worn an sharpened at teh uppr end til they lookd liek teh huge corroding fangs ov sum monstrous beast. in evry wai it corresponded wif teh scene ov teh old tragedy. sir henry wuz mutch interestd an askd stapleton moar than once whethr he did rly bleev in teh possibility ov teh interference ov teh supernatural in teh affairs ov men. he spoke lightly, but it wuz evident dat he wuz vary mutch in earnest. stapleton wuz guarded in hims replies, but it wuz easy 2 c dat he sed les than he might, an dat he wud not expres hims whole opinion out ov consideration 4 teh feelings ov teh baronet. he told us ov similar cases, wer families had suffered frum sum evil influence, an he left us wif teh impression dat he shard teh popular view upon teh matter. on r wai bak we stayed 4 lunch at merripit house, an it wuz thar dat sir henry made teh acquaintance ov miss stapleton. from teh furst moment dat he saw her he appeard 2 bees strongly attracted by her, an i am mutch mistaken if teh feelin wuz not mutual. he referred 2 her again an again on r walk home, an since then hardly  dai has passed dat we has not seen somethin ov teh brother an sister. they dine her tonight, an thar iz sum talk ov r goin 2 them next week. one wud imagine dat such  match wud bees vary welcom 2 stapleton, an yet i has moar than once caught  look ov teh strongest disapprobation in hims face when sir henry has been paying sum attenshun 2 hims sister. he iz mutch attachd 2 her, no doubt, an wud lead  lonely life without her, but it wud seem teh height ov selfishness if he wuz 2 stand in teh wai ov her makin so brilliant  marriage. yet i am certain dat he doez not wish der intimacy 2 ripen into love, an i has several tiems observed dat he has taken pains 2 prevent them frum bein _tête-à-tête_. by teh way, ur instrucshuns 2 me nevr 2 allow sir henry 2 go out alone will become vary mutch moar onerous if  luv affair wuz 2 bees addd 2 r othr difficulties. my popularity wud soon suffr if i wuz 2 carry out ur orderz 2 teh letter. the othr day—thursday, 2 bees moar exact—dr. mortimer lunched wif us. he has been excavating  barrow at long down an has got  prehistoric skull which fills him wif great joy. never wuz thar such  single-minded enthusiast as he! the stapletons came in afterwards, an teh gud doctor took us all 2 teh yew alley at sir henry’s request 2 show us egsaktly how everythin occurred upon dat fatal night. it iz  long, dismal walk, teh yew alley, tween 2 high walls ov clipped hedge, wif  narrow band ov grass upon eithr side. at teh far end iz an old tumble-down summer-house. halfway down iz teh moor-gate, wer teh old gentleman left hims cigar-ash. it iz  white wooden gate wif  latch. beyond it lies teh wide moor. i remembered ur theory ov teh affair an trid 2 picture all dat had occurred. as teh old man stood thar he saw somethin comin acros teh moor, somethin which terrified him so dat he lost hims wits an ran an ran til he did ov sheer horror an exhaustion. there wuz teh long, gloomy tunnel down which he fled. and frum what? a sheep-dog ov teh moor? or  spectral hound, black, silent, an monstrous? was thar  human agency in teh matter? did teh pale, watchful barrymore knoe moar than he cared 2 say? it wuz all dim an vague, but alwayz thar iz teh dark shadow ov crime behind it. one othr neighbour i has met since i wrote last. this iz mr. frankland, ov lafter hall, hoo lives sum 4 miles 2 teh south ov us. he iz an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, an choleric. his passion iz 4 teh british law, an he has spent  large fortune in litigation. he fights 4 teh mere pleasure ov fighting an iz equally ready 2 taek up eithr side ov  question, so dat it iz no wondr dat he has findz it  costly amusement. sometimes he will shut up  rite ov wai an defy teh parish 2 mak him open it. at otherz he will wif hims own hanz tear down sum othr man’s gate an declare dat  path has existd thar frum tiem immemorial, defying teh ownr 2 prosecute him 4 trespass. he iz learnd in old manorial an communal rights, an he appliez hims knowledge sometimez in favour ov teh villagers ov fernworthy an sometimez against them, so dat he iz periodically eithr carried in triumph down teh village street or else burnd in effigy, accordin 2 hims latest exploit. he iz sed 2 has bout seven lawsuits upon hims hanz at present, which will probably swallow up teh remainder ov hims fortune an so draw hims sting an leef him harmless 4 teh future. apart frum teh law he seemz  kindly, good-natured person, an i only menshun him cuz u wuz particular dat i shud send sum descripshun ov teh peeps hoo surround us. he iz curiously employd at present, for, bein an amateur astronomer, he has an awsum telescope, wif which he lies upon teh roof ov hims own houz an sweeps teh moor all dai in teh hope ov catching  glimpse ov teh escaped convict. if he wud confine hims energies 2 dis all wud bees well, but thar r rumours dat he intends 2 prosecute dr. mortimer 4 openin  grave without teh consent ov teh next ov kin cuz he dug up teh neolithic skull in teh barrow on long down. he helpz 2 keep r lives frum bein monotonous an givez  lil comic relief wer it iz badly needed. and now, havin brought u up 2 date in teh escaped convict, teh stapletons, dr. mortimer, an frankland, ov lafter hall, let me end on dat which iz most important an tell u moar bout teh barrymores, an especially bout teh surprisn development ov last night. first ov all bout teh test telegram, which u sent frum london in ordr 2 mak sure dat barrymore wuz rly here. i has already explaind dat teh testimony ov teh postmaster showz dat teh test wuz worthless an dat we has no proof wan wai or teh other. i told sir henry how teh mattr stood, an he at once, in hims downright fashion, had barrymore up an askd him whethr he had receivd teh telegram himself. barrymore sed dat he had. “did teh boi delivr it into ur own hands?” askd sir henry. barrymore lookd surprised, an considerd 4  lil time. “no,” sed he, “i wuz in teh box-room at teh time, an mah wife brought it up 2 me.” “did u anzwr it yourself?” “no; i told mah wife wut 2 anzwr an she went down 2 rite it.” in teh evening he recurred 2 teh subject ov hims own accord. “i cud not quite understand teh object ov ur queshuns dis morning, sir henry,” sed he. “i trust dat they doez not mean dat i has dun anythin 2 forfeit ur confidence?” sir henry had 2 assure him dat it wuz not so an pacify him by givin him  considerable part ov hims old wardrobe, teh london outfit havin nao all arrived. mrs. barrymore iz ov interest 2 me. she iz  heavy, solid person, vary limited, intensely respectable, an inclined 2 bees puritanical. you cud hardly conceive  les emotional subject. yet i has told u how, on teh furst night here, i herd her sobbing bitterly, an since then i has moar than once observed traces ov tears upon her face. some deep sorrow gnaws evr at her heart. sometimes i wondr if she has  guilty mems which haunts her, an sometimez i suspect barrymore ov bein  domestic tyrant. i has alwayz felt dat thar wuz somethin singular an questionable in dis man’s character, but teh adventure ov last night bringz all mah suspicions 2  head. and yet it cud seem  small mattr in itself. you r aware dat i am not  vary sound sleeper, an since i has been on guard in dis houz mah slumbers has been lighter than ever. last night, bout 2 in teh morning, i wuz aroused by  stealthy step passing mah room. i rose, opened mah door, an peeped out. a long black shadow wuz trailing down teh corridor. it wuz thrown by  man hoo walked softly down teh passage wif  candle held in hims hand. he wuz in shirt an trousers, wif no coverin 2 hims feet. i cud merely c teh outline, but hims height told me dat it wuz barrymore. he walked vary slowly an circumspectly, an thar wuz somethin indescribably guilty an furtive in hims whole appearance. i has told u dat teh corridor iz brokd by teh balcony which runz round teh hall, but dat it iz resumed upon teh farther side. i waited til he had passed out ov sight an then i followed him. when i came round teh balcony he had reachd teh end ov teh farther corridor, an i cud c frum teh glimmer ov light thru an open door dat he had entered wan ov teh rooms. now, all thees rooms r unfurnished an unoccupied so dat hims expedition became moar mysterious than ever. the light shone steadily as if he wuz standing motionless. i crept down teh passage as noiselessly as i cud an peeped round teh corner ov teh door. barrymore wuz crouching at teh window wif teh candle held against teh glass. his profile wuz haf turnd towardz me, an hims face seemd 2 bees rigid wif expectation as he stared out into teh blackness ov teh moor. for sum minutez he stood watchin intently. then he gaev  deep groan an wif an impatient gesture he put out teh light. instantly i made mah wai bak 2 mah room, an vary shortly came teh stealthy stepz passing once moar upon der return journey. long afterwards when i had fallen into  light sleep i herd  key turn somewhere in  lock, but i cud not tell whence teh sound came. what it all meanz i cannot guess, but thar iz sum seekret busines goin on in dis houz ov gloom which sooner or latr we shall git 2 teh bottom of. i doez not trouble u wif mah theories, 4 u askd me 2 furnish u only wif facts. i has had  long talk wif sir henry dis morning, an we has made  plan ov campaign founded upon mah observashuns ov last night. i will not speak bout it jus now, but it shud mak mah next report interestin reading. chapter 9. the light upon teh moor [second report ov dr. watson] baskerville hall, oct. 15th. my dear holmes, if i wuz compelled 2 leef u without mutch newz durin teh early dais ov mah mishun u must acknowledge dat i am makin up 4 lost time, an dat eventz r nao crowding thick an fast upon us. in mah last report i endd upon mah top note wif barrymore at teh window, an nao i has quite  budget already which will, unles i am mutch mistaken, considerably surprise you. things has taken  turn which i cud not has anticipated. in sum wayz they has within teh last forty-eight hourz become mutch clearr an in sum wayz they has become moar complicated. but i will tell u all an u shall judge 4 yourself. before breakfast on teh mornin followin mah adventure i went down teh corridor an examined teh room in which barrymore had been on teh night before. the western window thru which he had stared so intently has, i noticed, wan peculiarity above all othr windowz in teh house—it commandz teh nearest outlook on 2 teh moor. there iz an openin tween 2 trees which enablez wan frum dis point ov view 2 look rite down upon it, while frum all teh othr windowz it iz only  distant glimpse which can bees obtained. it follows, therefore, dat barrymore, since only dis window wud serve teh purpose, must has been lukingz out 4 somethin or somebody upon teh moor. the night wuz vary dark, so dat i can hardly imagine how he cud has hopd 2 c anyone. it had struck me dat it wuz posible dat sum luv intrigue wuz on foot. that wud has accounted 4 hims stealthy movements an also 4 teh uneasiness ov hims wife. the man iz  striking-looking fellow, vary well equippd 2 steel teh heart ov  country girl, so dat dis theory seemd 2 has somethin 2 support it. that openin ov teh door which i had herd aftr i had returned 2 mah room might mean dat he had gone out 2 keep sum clandestine appointment. so i reasoned wif myself in teh morning, an i tell u teh direcshun ov mah suspicions, howevr mutch teh result cud has shown dat they wuz unfounded. but whatevr teh true explanashun ov barrymore’s movements might be, i felt dat teh responsibility ov keepin them 2 myself til i cud explain them wuz moar than i cud bear. i had an interview wif teh baronet in hims study aftr breakfast, an i told him all dat i had seen. he wuz les surprisd than i had expected. “i knew dat barrymore walked bout nights, an i had  mind 2 speak 2 him bout it,” sed he. “two or 3 tiems i has herd hims stepz in teh passage, comin an going, jus bout teh hour u name.” “perhaps then he pays  visit evry night 2 dat particular window,” i suggested. “perhaps he does. if so, we shud bees able 2 shadow him an c wut it iz dat he iz after. i wondr wut ur frend holmes wud doez if he wuz here.” “i bleev dat he wud doez egsaktly wut u nao suggest,” sed i. “he wud follow barrymore an c wut he did.” “then we shall doez it together.” “but surely he wud hear us.” “the man iz rathr deaf, an in any case we must taek r chance ov that. we’ll sit up in mah room tonite an wait til he passes.” sir henry rubbed hims hanz wif pleasure, an it wuz evident dat he hailed teh adventure as  relief 2 hims somewhat quiet life upon teh moor. the baronet has been in communication wif teh architect hoo prepared teh planz 4 sir charles, an wif  contractor frum london, so dat we cud expect great changez 2 begin her soon. there has been decorators an furnishers up frum plymouth, an it iz evident dat r frend has large ideaz an meanz 2 spare no pains or expense 2 restore teh grandeur ov hims family. when teh houz iz renovated an refurnished, all dat he will ned will bees  wife 2 mak it complete. between ourselves thar r pritee clear signz dat dis will not bees wantin if teh lady iz willing, 4 i has seldom seen  man moar infatuated wif  woman than he iz wif r beautiful neighbour, miss stapleton. and yet teh course ov true luv doez not run quite as smoothly as wan wud undr teh circumstances expect. today, 4 example, itz surface wuz brokd by  vary unexpectd ripple, which has caused r frend considerable perplexity an annoyance. after teh conversashun which i has quoted bout barrymore, sir henry put on hims hat an prepared 2 go out. as  mattr ov course i did teh same. “what, r _you_ coming, watson?” he asked, lukingz at me in  curious way. “that depends on whethr u r goin on teh moor,” sed i. “yes, i am.” “well, u knoe wut mah instrucshuns are. i am sry 2 intrude, but u herd how earnestly holmes insisted dat i shud not leef you, an especially dat u shud not go alone upon teh moor.” sir henry put hims hand upon mah shoulder wif  pleasant smile. “my dear fellow,” sed he, “holmes, wif all hims wisdom, did not foresee sum tings which has happend since i has been on teh moor. you understand me? i am sure dat u r teh last man in teh wurld hoo wud wish 2 bees  spoil-sport. i must go out alone.” it put me in  most awkward position. i wuz at  loss wut 2 sai or wut 2 do, an b4 i had made up mah mind he pickd up hims cane an wuz gone. but when i came 2 finks teh mattr ovar mah conscience reproached me bitterly 4 havin on any pretext allowd him 2 go out ov mah sight. i imagined wut mah feelings wud bees if i had 2 return 2 u an 2 confess dat sum misfortune had occurred thru mah disregard 4 ur instructions. i assure u mah cheeks flushed at teh vary thought. it might not even nao bees 2 late 2 overtake him, so i set off at once in teh direcshun ov merripit house. i hurried along teh road at teh top ov mah sped without seein anythin ov sir henry, til i came 2 teh point wer teh moor path branches off. there, fearing dat perhapz i had come in teh wrong direcshun aftr all, i mounted  hill frum which i cud command  view—the same hill which iz cut into teh dark quarry. thence i saw him at once. he wuz on teh moor path bout  quartr ov  mile off, an  lady wuz by hims side hoo cud only bees miss stapleton. it wuz clear dat thar wuz already an understandin tween them an dat they had met by appointment. they wuz walking slowly along in deep conversation, an i saw her makin quick lil movements ov her hanz as if she wuz vary earnest in wut she wuz saying, while he listend intently, an once or twice shook hims hed in strong dissent. i stood among teh rocks watchin them, vary mutch puzzled as 2 wut i shud doez next. to follow them an break into der intimate conversashun seemd 2 bees an outrage, an yet mah clear duty wuz nevr 4 an instant 2 let him out ov mah sight. to act teh spy upon  frend wuz  hateful task. still, i cud c no bettr course than 2 observe him frum teh hill, an 2 clear mah conscience by confessin 2 him afterwards wut i had done. it iz true dat if any sudden dangr had threatened him i wuz 2 far away 2 bees ov use, an yet i am sure dat u will agree wif me dat teh posishun wuz vary difficult, an dat thar wuz nothin moar which i cud do. our friend, sir henry, an teh lady had halted on teh path an wuz standing deeply absorbd in der conversation, when i wuz suddenly aware dat i wuz not teh only witness ov der interview. a wisp ov green floatin in teh air caught mah eye, an anothr glance showd me dat it wuz carried on  stick by  man hoo wuz movin among teh brokd ground. it wuz stapleton wif hims butterfly-net. he wuz vary mutch closer 2 teh pair than i was, an he appeard 2 bees movin in der direction. at dis instant sir henry suddenly drew miss stapleton 2 hims side. his arm wuz round her, but it seemd 2 me dat she wuz straining away frum him wif her face averted. he stooped hims hed 2 hers, an she raisd wan hand as if in protest. next moment i saw them spring apart an turn hurriedly round. stapleton wuz teh cause ov teh interruption. he wuz runnin wildly towardz them, hims absurd net dangling behind him. he gesticulated an almost danced wif excitement in frunt ov teh lovers. what teh scene meant i cud not imagine, but it seemd 2 me dat stapleton wuz abusing sir henry, hoo offrd explanations, which became moar angry as teh othr refused 2 accept them. the lady stood by in haughty silence. finally stapleton turnd upon hims heel an beckoned in  peremptory wai 2 hims sister, who, aftr an irresolute glance at sir henry, walked off by teh side ov her brother. the naturalist’s angry gesturez showd dat teh lady wuz includd in hims displeasure. the baronet stood 4  minute lukingz aftr them, an then he walked slowly bak teh wai dat he had come, hims hed hanging, teh vary picture ov dejection. what all dis meant i cud not imagine, but i wuz deeply ashamed 2 has witnessed so intimate  scene without mah friend’s knowledge. i ran down teh hill therefore an met teh baronet at teh bottom. his face wuz flushed wif anger an hims brows wuz wrinkled, liek wan hoo iz at hims wit’s endz wut 2 do. “halloa, watson! where has u droppd from?” sed he. “you don’t mean 2 sai dat u came aftr me in spite ov all?” i explaind everythin 2 him: how i had findz it impossible 2 remain behind, how i had followed him, an how i had witnessed all dat had occurred. for an instant hims eyes blazed at me, but mah frankness disarmed hims anger, an he broke at last into  rathr rueful laugh. “you wud has thot teh middle ov dat prairie  fairly safe place 4  man 2 bees private,” sed he, “but, by thunder, teh whole countryside seemz 2 has been out 2 c me doez mah wooing—and  mighty poor wooing at that! where had u engaged  seat?” “i wuz on dat hill.” “quite in teh bak row, eh? but her brother wuz well up 2 teh front. did u c him come out on us?” “yes, i did.” “did he evr strike u as bein crazy—this brother ov hers?” “i can’t sai dat he evr did.” “i dare sai not. i alwayz thot him sane enough til today, but u can taek it frum me dat eithr he or i ought 2 bees in  straitjacket. what’s teh mattr wif me, anyhow? you’ve lived near me 4 sum weeks, watson. tell me straight, now! is thar anythin dat wud prevent me frum makin  gud husband 2  woman dat i loved?” “i shud sai not.” “he can’t object 2 mah worldly position, so it must bees myself dat he has dis down on. what has he against me? i nevr hurt man or woman in mah life dat i knoe of. and yet he wud not so mutch as let me touch teh tips ov her fingers.” “did he sai so?” “that, an  deal more. i tell you, watson, i’ve only known her thees few weeks, but frum teh furst i jus felt dat she wuz made 4 me, an she, too—she wuz happeh when she wuz wif me, an dat i’ll swear. there’s  light in  woman’s eyes dat speaks louder than words. but he has nevr let us git togehtr an it wuz only todai 4 teh furst tiem dat i saw  chance ov havin  few werdz wif her alone. she wuz glad 2 meet me, but when she did it wuz not luv dat she wud talk about, an she wouldn’t has let me talk bout it eithr if she cud has stopped it. she kept comin bak 2 it dat dis wuz  place ov danger, an dat she wud nevr bees happeh til i had left it. i told her dat since i had seen her i wuz in no hurry 2 leef it, an dat if she rly wantd me 2 go, teh only wai 2 werk it wuz 4 her 2 arrange 2 go wif me. with dat i offrd in as lotz da werdz 2 marry her, but b4 she cud answer, down came dis brother ov hers, runnin at us wif  face on him liek  madman. he wuz jus white wif rage, an dose light eyes ov hims wuz blazing wif fury. what wuz i doin wif teh lady? how dared i offr her attentions which wuz distasteful 2 her? did i finks dat cuz i wuz  baronet i cud doez wut i liked? if he had not been her brother i shud has known bettr how 2 anzwr him. as it wuz i told him dat mah feelings towardz hims sister wuz such as i wuz not ashamed of, an dat i hopd dat she might honour me by becoming mah wife. that seemd 2 mak teh mattr no better, so then i lost mah temper too, an i anzwerd him rathr moar hotly than i shud perhaps, considerin dat she wuz standing by. so it endd by hims goin off wif her, as u saw, an her am i as badly puzzled  man as any in dis county. just tell me wut it all means, watson, an i’ll owe u moar than evr i can hope 2 pay.” i trid wan or 2 explanations, but, indeed, i wuz completely puzzled myself. our friend’s title, hims fortune, hims age, hims character, an hims appearance r all in hims favour, an i knoe nothin against him unles it bees dis dark fate which runz in hims family. that hims advances shud bees rejectd so brusquely without any reference 2 teh lady’s own wishez an dat teh lady shud accept teh situashun without protest iz vary amazing. however, r conjectures wuz set at rest by  visit frum stapleton him dat vary afternoon. he had come 2 offr apologiez 4 hims rudeness ov teh morning, an aftr  long private interview wif sir henry in hims study teh upshot ov der conversashun wuz dat teh breach iz quite healed, an dat we r 2 dine at merripit house next friday as  sign ov it. “i don’t sai nao dat he isn’t  crazy man,” sed sir henry; “i can’t forget teh look in hims eyes when he ran at me dis morning, but i must allow dat no man cud mak  moar handsome apology than he has done.” “did he giv any explanashun ov hims conduct?” “his sister iz everythin in hims life, he says. that iz natural enough, an i am glad dat he shud understand her value. they has alwayz been together, an accordin 2 hims akownt he has been  vary lonely man wif only her as  companion, so dat teh thot ov losin her wuz rly terrible 2 him. he had not understood, he said, dat i wuz becoming attachd 2 her, but when he saw wif hims own eyes dat it wuz rly so, an dat she might bees taken away frum him, it gaev him such  shock dat 4  tiem he wuz not responsible 4 wut he sed or did. he wuz vary sry 4 all dat had passed, an he recognized how foolish an how selfish it wuz dat he shud imagine dat he cud hold  beautiful woman liek hims sister 2 him 4 her whole life. if she had 2 leef him he had rathr it wuz 2  neighbour liek myself than 2 anyone else. but in any case it wuz  blow 2 him an it wud taek him sum tiem b4 he cud prepare him 2 meet it. he wud withdraw all opposition upon hims part if i wud promise 4 3 monthz 2 let teh mattr rest an 2 bees content wif cultivating teh lady’s friendship durin dat tiem without claiming her love. this i promised, an so teh mattr rests.” so thar iz wan ov r small mysteries cleared up. it iz somethin 2 has touched bottom anywhere in dis bog in which we r floundering. we knoe nao y stapleton lookd wif disfavour upon hims sister’s suitor—even when dat suitor wuz so eligible  wan as sir henry. and nao i pas on 2 anothr thread which i has extricated out ov teh tangled skein, teh mystery ov teh sobs in teh night, ov teh tear-stained face ov mrs. barrymore, ov teh seekret journey ov teh butler 2 teh western lattice window. congratulate me, mah dear holmes, an tell me dat i has not disappointd u as an agent—that u doez not regret teh confidence which u showd in me when u sent me down. all thees tings has by wan night’s werk been thoroughly cleared. i has sed “by wan night’s work,” but, in truth, it wuz by 2 nights’ work, 4 on teh furst we drew entirely blank. i sat up wif sir henry in hims rooms til nearly 3 o’clock in teh morning, but no sound ov any sort did we hear except teh chiming clock upon teh stairs. it wuz  most melancholy vigil an endd by each ov us falling asleep in r chairs. fortunately we wuz not discouraged, an we determind 2 try again. the next night we lowered teh lamp an sat smoking cigarettes without makin teh least sound. it wuz incredible how slowly teh hourz crawled by, an yet we wuz helpd thru it by teh same sort ov patient interest which teh hunter must feelz as he watches teh trap into which he hopes teh game cud wander. one struck, an two, an we had almost 4 teh second tiem given it up in despair when in an instant we both sat bolt upright in r chairs wif all r weary senses keenly on teh alert once more. we had herd teh creak ov  step in teh passage. very stealthily we herd it pas along til it did away in teh distance. then teh baronet gently opened hims door an we set out in pursuit. already r man had gone round teh gallery an teh corridor wuz all in darkness. softly we stole along til we had come into teh othr wing. we wuz jus in tiem 2 catch  glimpse ov teh tall, black-bearded figure, hims shoulders rounded as he tiptoed down teh passage. then he passed thru teh same door as before, an teh light ov teh candle framed it in teh darkness an shot wan single yellow beam acros teh gloom ov teh corridor. we shuffled cautiously towardz it, tryin evry plank b4 we dared 2 put r whole weight upon it. we had taken teh precaution ov leaving r boots behind us, but, even so, teh old boards snapped an creaked beneath r tread. sometimes it seemd impossible dat he shud fail 2 hear r approach. however, teh man iz fortunately rathr deaf, an he wuz entirely preoccupied in dat which he wuz doing. when at last we reachd teh door an peeped thru we findz him crouching at teh window, candle in hand, hims white, intent face pressed against teh pane, egsaktly as i had seen him 2 nights before. we had arranged no plan ov campaign, but teh baronet iz  man 2 whom teh most direct wai iz alwayz teh most natural. he walked into teh room, an as he did so barrymore sprang up frum teh window wif  sharp hiss ov hims breath an stood, livid an trembling, b4 us. his dark eyes, glaring out ov teh white mask ov hims face, wuz fol ov horror an astonishment as he gazed frum sir henry 2 me. “what r u doin here, barrymore?” “nothing, sir.” his agitation wuz so great dat he cud hardly speak, an teh shadows sprang up an down frum teh shaking ov hims candle. “it wuz teh window, sir. i go round at night 2 c dat they r fastened.” “on teh second floor?” “yes, sir, all teh windows.” “look here, barrymore,” sed sir henry sternly, “we has made up r mindz 2 has teh truth out ov you, so it will save u trouble 2 tell it sooner rathr than later. come, now! no lies! what wuz u doin at dat window?” the fellow lookd at us in  helpless way, an he wrung hims hanz togehtr liek wan hoo iz in teh last extremity ov doubt an misery. “i wuz doin no harm, sir. i wuz holdin  candle 2 teh window.” “and y wuz u holdin  candle 2 teh window?” “don’t ask me, sir henry—don’t ask me! i giv u mah word, sir, dat it iz not mah secret, an dat i cannot tell it. if it concerned no wan but myself i wud not try 2 keep it frum you.” a sudden idea occurred 2 me, an i took teh candle frum teh trembling hand ov teh butler. “he must has been holdin it as  signal,” sed i. “let us c if thar iz any answer.” i held it as he had done, an stared out into teh darkness ov teh night. vaguely i cud discern teh black bank ov teh trees an teh lighter expanse ov teh moor, 4 teh moon wuz behind teh clouds. and then i gaev  cry ov exultation, 4  tiny pinpoint ov yellow light had suddenly transfixed teh dark veil, an glowed steadily in teh centre ov teh black square framed by teh window. “there it is!” i cried. “no, no, sir, it iz nothing—nothing at all!” teh butler broke in; “i assure you, sir—” “move ur light acros teh window, watson!” cried teh baronet. “see, teh othr movez also! now, u rascal, doez u deny dat it iz  signal? come, speak up! who iz ur confederate out yonder, an wut iz dis conspiracy dat iz goin on?” the man’s face became openly defiant. “it iz mah business, an not yours. i will not tell.” “then u leef mah employment rite away.” “very good, sir. if i must i must.” “and u go in disgrace. by thunder, u cud well bees ashamed ov yourself. your family has lived wif mine 4 ovar  hundrd yeers undr dis roof, an her i find u deep in sum dark plot against me.” “no, no, sir; no, not against you!” it wuz  woman’s voice, an mrs. barrymore, paler an moar horror-struck than her husband, wuz standing at teh door. her bulky figure in  shawl an skirt might has been comic wuz it not 4 teh intensity ov feelin upon her face. “we has 2 go, eliza. this iz teh end ov it. you can pack r things,” sed teh butler. “oh, john, john, has i brought u 2 this? it iz mah doing, sir henry—all mine. he has dun nothin except 4 mah sake an cuz i askd him.” “speak out, then! what doez it mean?” “my unhappy brother iz starving on teh moor. we cannot let him perish at r vary gates. the light iz  signal 2 him dat food iz ready 4 him, an hims light out yonder iz 2 show teh spot 2 which 2 brin it.” “then ur brother is—” “the escaped convict, sir—selden, teh criminal.” “that’s teh truth, sir,” sed barrymore. “i sed dat it wuz not mah seekret an dat i cud not tell it 2 you. but nao u has herd it, an u will c dat if thar wuz  plot it wuz not against you.” this, then, wuz teh explanashun ov teh stealthy expeditions at night an teh light at teh window. sir henry an i both stared at teh woman in amazement. was it posible dat dis stolidly respectable person wuz ov teh same blood as wan ov teh most notorious criminals in teh country? “yes, sir, mah naym wuz selden, an he iz mah youngr brother. we humoured him 2 mutch when he wuz  lad an gaev him hims own wai in everythin til he came 2 finks dat teh wurld wuz made 4 hims pleasure, an dat he cud doez wut he likd in it. then as he grew older he met wicked companions, an teh devil entered into him til he broke mah mother’s heart an dragged r naym in teh dirt. from crime 2 crime he sank lower an lower til it iz only teh mercy ov god which has snatched him frum teh scaffold; but 2 me, sir, he wuz alwayz teh lil curly-headed boi dat i had nursed an playd wif as an elder sister would. that wuz y he broke prison, sir. he knew dat i wuz her an dat we cud not refuse 2 halp him. when he dragged him her wan night, weary an starving, wif teh warders hard at hims heels, wut cud we do? we took him in an fed him an cared 4 him. then u returned, sir, an mah brother thot he wud bees safer on teh moor than anywhere else til teh hue an cry wuz over, so he lay in hiding there. but evry second night we made sure if he wuz still thar by puttin  light in teh window, an if thar wuz an anzwr mah husband took out sum bread an meat 2 him. every dai we hopd dat he wuz gone, but as long as he wuz thar we cud not desert him. that iz teh whole truth, as i am an honest christian woman an u will c dat if thar iz blame in teh mattr it doez not lie wif mah husband but wif me, 4 whose sake he has dun all dat he has.” the woman’s werdz came wif an intense earnestness which carried conviction wif them. “is dis true, barrymore?” “yes, sir henry. every werd ov it.” “well, i cannot blame u 4 standing by ur own wife. forget wut i has said. go 2 ur room, u two, an we shall talk furthr bout dis mattr in teh morning.” when they wuz gone we lookd out ov teh window again. sir henry had flung it open, an teh cold night wind beat in upon r faces. far away in teh black distance thar still glowed dat wan tiny point ov yellow light. “i wondr he dares,” sed sir henry. “it cud bees so placed as 2 bees only visible frum here.” “very likely. how far doez u finks it is?” “out by teh cleft tor, i think.” “not moar than  mile or 2 off.” “hardly that.” “well, it cannot bees far if barrymore had 2 carry out teh food 2 it. and he iz waiting, dis villain, beside dat candle. by thunder, watson, i am goin out 2 taek dat man!” the same thot had crossd mah own mind. it wuz not as if teh barrymores had taken us into der confidence. their seekret had been forcd frum them. the man wuz  dangr 2 teh community, an unmitigated scoundrel 4 whom thar wuz neithr pity nor excuse. we wuz only doin r duty in takin dis chance ov puttin him bak wer he cud doez no harm. with hims brutal an violent nature, otherz wud has 2 pay teh price if we held r hands. any night, 4 example, r neighbours teh stapletons might bees attacked by him, an it cud has been teh thot ov dis which made sir henry so keen upon teh adventure. “i will come,” sed i. “then git ur revolver an put on ur boots. the sooner we start teh better, as teh fellow cud put out hims light an bees off.” in five minutez we wuz outside teh door, startin upon r expedition. we hurried thru teh dark shrubbery, amid teh dull moaning ov teh autumn wind an teh rustle ov teh falling leaves. the night air wuz heavy wif teh smell ov damp an decay. now an again teh moon peeped out 4 an instant, but clouds wuz drivin ovar teh face ov teh sky, an jus as we came out on teh moor  thin rain began 2 fall. the light still burnd steadily in front. “are u armed?” i asked. “i has  hunting-crop.” “we must close in on him rapidly, 4 he iz sed 2 bees  desperate fellow. we shall taek him by surprise an has him at r mercy b4 he can resist.” “i say, watson,” sed teh baronet, “what wud holmes sai 2 this? how bout dat hour ov darkness in which teh powr ov evil iz exalted?” as if in anzwr 2 hims werdz thar rose suddenly out ov teh vast gloom ov teh moor dat strange cry which i had already herd upon teh borderz ov teh great grimpen mire. it came wif teh wind thru teh silence ov teh night,  long, deep mutter, then  rising howl, an then teh sad moan in which it did away. again an again it sounded, teh whole air throbbing wif it, strident, wild, an menacing. the baronet caught mah sleeve an hims face glimmered white thru teh darkness. “my god, what’s that, watson?” “i don’t know. it’s  sound they has on teh moor. i herd it once before.” it did away, an an absolute silence closed in upon us. we stood straining r ears, but nothin came. “watson,” sed teh baronet, “it wuz teh cry ov  hound.” my blood ran cold in mah veins, 4 thar wuz  break in hims voice which told ov teh sudden horror which had seized him. “what doez they call dis sound?” he asked. “who?” “the folk on teh countryside.” “oh, they r ignorant people. why shud u mind wut they call it?” “tell me, watson. what doez they sai ov it?” i hesitated but cud not escape teh question. “they sai it iz teh cry ov teh hound ov teh baskervilles.” he groaned an wuz silent 4  few moments. “a hound it was,” he sed at last, “but it seemd 2 come frum miles away, ovar yonder, i think.” “it wuz hard 2 sai whence it came.” “it rose an fell wif teh wind. isn’t dat teh direcshun ov teh great grimpen mire?” “yes, it is.” “well, it wuz up there. come now, watson, didn’t u finks yourself dat it wuz teh cry ov  hound? i am not  child. you ned not fear 2 speak teh truth.” “stapleton wuz wif me when i herd it last. he sed dat it might bees teh callin ov  strange bird.” “no, no, it wuz  hound. my god, can thar bees sum truth in all thees stories? is it posible dat i am rly in dangr frum so dark  cause? you don’t bleev it, doez you, watson?” “no, no.” “and yet it wuz wan ting 2 laff bout it in london, an it iz anothr 2 stand out her in teh darkness ov teh moor an 2 hear such  cry as that. and mah uncle! there wuz teh footprint ov teh hound beside him as he lay. it all fitz together. i don’t finks dat i am  coward, watson, but dat sound seemd 2 freeze mah vary blood. feel mah hand!” it wuz as cold as  block ov marble. “you’ll bees all rite tomorrow.” “i don’t finks i’ll git dat cry out ov mah head. what doez u advise dat we doez now?” “shall we turn back?” “no, by thunder; we has come out 2 git r man, an we will doez it. we aftr teh convict, an  hell-hound, as likely as not, aftr us. come on! we’ll c it thru if all teh fiends ov teh pit wuz loose upon teh moor.” we stumbled slowly along in teh darkness, wif teh black loom ov teh craggy hills around us, an teh yellow speck ov light burning steadily in front. there iz nothin so deceptive as teh distance ov  light upon  pitch-dark night, an sometimez teh glimmer seemd 2 bees far away upon teh horizon an sometimez it might has been within  few yardz ov us. but at last we cud c whence it came, an then we knew dat we wuz inded vary close. a guttering candle wuz stuck in  crevice ov teh rocks which flanked it on each side so as 2 keep teh wind frum it an also 2 prevent it frum bein visible, save in teh direcshun ov baskerville hall. a boulder ov granite concealed r approach, an crouching behind it we gazed ovar it at teh signal light. it wuz strange 2 c dis single candle burning thar in teh middle ov teh moor, wif no sign ov life near it—just teh wan straight yellow flame an teh gleam ov teh rock on each side ov it. “what shall we doez now?” whispered sir henry. “wait here. he must bees near hims light. let us c if we can git  glimpse ov him.” the werdz wuz hardly out ov mah mouth when we both saw him. over teh rocks, in teh crevice ov which teh candle burned, thar wuz thrust out an evil yellow face,  terrible animal face, all seamed an scord wif vile passions. foul wif mire, wif  bristling beard, an hung wif matted hair, it might well has belonged 2 wan ov dose old savages hoo dwelt in teh burrowz on teh hillsides. the light beneath him wuz reflected in hims small, cunning eyes which peered fiercely 2 rite an left thru teh darkness liek  crafty an savage animal hoo has herd teh stepz ov teh hunters. something had evidently aroused hims suspicions. it cud has been dat barrymore had sum private signal which we had neglected 2 give, or teh fellow cud has had sum othr reason 4 thinkin dat all wuz not well, but i cud read hims fears upon hims wicked face. any instant he might dash out teh light an vanish in teh darkness. i sprang forward therefore, an sir henry did teh same. at teh same moment teh convict screamed out  curse at us an hurled  rock which splintered up against teh boulder which had sheltered us. i caught wan glimpse ov hims short, squat, strongly built figure as he sprang 2 hims feet an turnd 2 run. at teh same moment by  lucky chance teh moon broke thru teh clouds. we rushed ovar teh brow ov teh hill, an thar wuz r man runnin wif great sped down teh othr side, springing ovar teh stones in hims wai wif teh activity ov  mountain goat. a lucky long shot ov mah revolver might has crippled him, but i had brought it only 2 defend myself if attacked an not 2 shoot an unarmed man hoo wuz runnin away. we wuz both swift runners an in fairly gud training, but we soon findz dat we had no chance ov overtaking him. we saw him 4  long tiem in teh moonlight til he wuz only  small speck movin swiftly among teh boulders upon teh side ov  distant hill. we ran an ran til we wuz completely blown, but teh space tween us grew evr wider. finally we stopped an sat panting on 2 rocks, while we watched him disapperin in teh distance. and it wuz at dis moment dat thar occurred  most strange an unexpectd thing. we had risen frum r rocks an wuz turning 2 go home, havin abandoned teh hopeless chase. the moon wuz low upon teh right, an teh jagged pinnacle ov  granite tor stood up against teh lower curve ov itz silvr disc. there, outlined as black as an ebony statue on dat shining background, i saw teh figure ov  man upon teh tor. do not finks dat it wuz  delusion, holmes. i assure u dat i has nevr in mah life seen anythin moar clearly. as far as i cud judge, teh figure wuz dat ov  tall, thin man. he stood wif hims legz  lil separated, hims arms folded, hims hed bowed, as if he wuz brooding ovar dat enormous wilderness ov peat an granite which lay b4 him. he might has been teh vary spirit ov dat terrible place. it wuz not teh convict. this man wuz far frum teh place wer teh lattr had disappeared. besides, he wuz  mutch taller man. with  cry ov surprise i pointed him out 2 teh baronet, but in teh instant durin which i had turnd 2 grasp hims arm teh man wuz gone. there wuz teh sharp pinnacle ov granite still cuttin teh lower edge ov teh moon, but itz peak bore no trace ov dat silent an motionless figure. i wishd 2 go in dat direcshun an 2 search teh tor, but it wuz sum distance away. the baronet’s nerves wuz still quivering frum dat cry, which recalled teh dark story ov hims family, an he wuz not in teh mood 4 fresh adventures. he had not seen dis lonely man upon teh tor an cud not feelz teh thrill which hims strange presence an hims commanding attitude had given 2 me. “a warder, no doubt,” sed he. “the moor has been thick wif them since dis fellow escaped.” well, perhapz hims explanashun cud bees teh rite one, but i shud liek 2 has sum furthr proof ov it. today we mean 2 communicate 2 teh princetown peeps wer they shud look 4 der missin man, but it iz hard linez dat we has not akshully had teh triumph ov bringin him bak as r own prisoner. such r teh adventures ov last night, an u must acknowledge, mah dear holmes, dat i has dun u vary well in teh mattr ov  report. much ov wut i tell u iz no doubt quite irrelevant, but still i feelz dat it iz best dat i shud let u has all teh facts an leef u 2 select 4 yourself dose which will bees ov most survis 2 u in helpin u 2 ur conclusions. we r certainly makin sum progress. so far as teh barrymores go we has findz teh motive ov der actions, an dat has cleared up teh situashun vary much. but teh moor wif itz mysteries an itz strange inhabitants remainz as inscrutable as ever. perhaps in mah next i cud bees able 2 throw sum light upon dis also. best ov all wud it bees if u cud come down 2 us. in any case u will hear frum me again in teh course ov teh next few days. chapter 10. extract frum teh diary ov dr. watson so far i has been able 2 quote frum teh reportz which i has forwarded durin thees early dais 2 sherlock holmes. now, however, i has arrivd at  point in mah narrative wer i am compelled 2 abandon dis method an 2 trust once moar 2 mah recollections, aided by teh diary which i kept at teh time. a few extracts frum teh lattr will carry me on 2 dose scneez which r indelibly fixd in evry detail upon mah memory. i proceed, then, frum teh mornin which followed r abortive chase ov teh convict an r othr strange experiencez upon teh moor. _october_ 16_th_.—a dull an foggy dai wif  drizzle ov rain. the houz iz banked in wif rollin clouds, which rise nao an then 2 show teh dreary curves ov teh moor, wif thin, silvr veins upon teh sides ov teh hills, an teh distant boulders gleaming wer teh light strikez upon der wet faces. it iz melancholy outside an in. the baronet iz in  black reacshun aftr teh excitements ov teh night. i am conscious myself ov  weight at mah heart an  feelin ov impending danger—ever present danger, which iz teh moar terrible cuz i am unable 2 define it. and has i not cause 4 such  feeling? consider teh long sequence ov incidents which has all pointed 2 sum sinister influence which iz at werk around us. there iz teh death ov teh last occupant ov teh hall, fulfilling so egsaktly teh condishuns ov teh family legend, an thar r teh repeatd reportz frum peasants ov teh appearance ov  strange creature upon teh moor. twice i has wif mah own ears herd teh sound which resembled teh distant baying ov  hound. it iz incredible, impossible, dat it shud rly bees outside teh ordinary lawz ov nature. a spectral hound which leaves material footmarks an fills teh air wif itz howling iz surely not 2 bees thot of. stapleton cud fall in wif such  superstition, an mortimer also, but if i has wan quality upon earth it iz common sense, an nothin will persuade me 2 bleev in such  thing. to doez so wud bees 2 descend 2 teh level ov thees poor peasants, hoo r not content wif  mere fiend dog but must needz describe him wif hell-fire shooting frum hims mouth an eyes. holmes wud not listen 2 such fancies, an i am hims agent. but facts r facts, an i has twice herd dis crying upon teh moor. suppose dat thar wuz rly sum huge hound loose upon it; dat wud go far 2 explain everything. but wer cud such  hound lie concealed, wer did it git itz food, wer did it come from, how wuz it dat no wan saw it by day? it must bees confessed dat teh natural explanashun offerz almost as lotz da difficulties as teh other. and always, apart frum teh hound, thar iz teh fact ov teh human agency in london, teh man in teh cab, an teh lettr which warnd sir henry against teh moor. this at least wuz real, but it might has been teh werk ov  protecting frend as easily as ov an enemy. where iz dat frend or enemy now? has he remained in london, or has he followed us down here? could he—could he bees teh stranger whom i saw upon teh tor? it iz true dat i has had only teh wan glance at him, an yet thar r sum tings 2 which i am ready 2 swear. he iz no wan whom i has seen down here, an i has nao met all teh neighbours. the figure wuz far taller than dat ov stapleton, far thinner than dat ov frankland. barrymore it might possibly has been, but we had left him behind us, an i am certain dat he cud not has followed us. a stranger then iz still dogging us, jus as  stranger doggd us in london. we has nevr shaken him off. if i cud lay mah hanz upon dat man, then at last we might find ourselves at teh end ov all r difficulties. to dis wan purpose i must nao devote all mah energies. my furst impulse wuz 2 tell sir henry all mah plans. my second an wisest wan iz 2 play mah own game an speak as lil as posible 2 anyone. he iz silent an distrait. his nerves has been strangely shaken by dat sound upon teh moor. i will sai nothin 2 add 2 hims anxieties, but i will taek mah own stepz 2 attain mah own end. we had  small scene dis mornin aftr breakfast. barrymore askd leef 2 speak wif sir henry, an they wuz closeted in hims study sum lil time. sitting in teh billiard-room i moar than once herd teh sound ov voices raised, an i had  pritee gud idea wut teh point wuz which wuz undr discussion. after  tiem teh baronet opened hims door an calld 4 me. “barrymore considerz dat he has  grievance,” he said. “he thinks dat it wuz unfair on r part 2 hunt hims brother-in-law down when he, ov hims own free will, had told us teh secret.” the butler wuz standing vary pale but vary collected b4 us. “i cud has spoken 2 warmly, sir,” sed he, “and if i have, i am sure dat i beg ur pardon. at teh same time, i wuz vary mutch surprisd when i herd u 2 gentlemen come bak dis mornin an learnd dat u had been chasing selden. the poor fellow has enough 2 fight against without mah puttin moar upon hims track.” “if u had told us ov ur own free will it wud has been  different thing,” sed teh baronet, “you only told us, or rathr ur wife only told us, when it wuz forcd frum u an u cud not halp yourself.” “i didn’t finks u wud has taken advantage ov it, sir henry—indeed i didn’t.” “the man iz  public danger. there r lonely houses scattered ovar teh moor, an he iz  fellow hoo wud stick at nothing. you only wants 2 git  glimpse ov hims face 2 c that. look at mr. stapleton’s house, 4 example, wif no wan but him 2 defend it. there’s no safety 4 anyone til he iz undr lock an key.” “he’ll break into no house, sir. i giv u mah solemn werd upon that. but he will nevr trouble anyone in dis country again. i assure you, sir henry, dat in  vary few dais teh necessary arrangements will has been made an he will bees on hims wai 2 south america. for god’s sake, sir, i beg ov u not 2 let teh police knoe dat he iz still on teh moor. they has given up teh chase there, an he can lie quiet til teh ship iz ready 4 him. you can’t tell on him without gettin mah wife an me into trouble. i beg you, sir, 2 sai nothin 2 teh police.” “what doez u say, watson?” i shrugged mah shoulders. “if he wuz safely out ov teh country it wud relieve teh tax-payer ov  burden.” “but how bout teh chance ov hims holdin someone up b4 he goes?” “he wud not doez anythin so mad, sir. we has providd him wif all dat he can want. to commit  crime wud bees 2 show wer he wuz hiding.” “that iz true,” sed sir henry. “well, barrymore—” “god bless you, sir, an thank u frum mah heart! it wud has killd mah poor wife had he been taken again.” “i gues we r aiding an abetting  felony, watson? but, aftr wut we has herd i don’t feelz as if i cud giv teh man up, so thar iz an end ov it. all right, barrymore, u can go.” with  few brokd werdz ov gratitude teh man turned, but he hesitated an then came back. “you’ve been so kind 2 us, sir, dat i shud liek 2 doez teh best i can 4 u in return. i knoe something, sir henry, an perhapz i shud has sed it before, but it wuz long aftr teh inquest dat i findz it out. i’ve nevr breathed  werd bout it yet 2 mortal man. it’s bout poor sir charles’s death.” the baronet an i wuz both upon r feet. “do u knoe how he died?” “no, sir, i don’t knoe that.” “what then?” “i knoe y he wuz at teh gate at dat hour. it wuz 2 meet  woman.” “to meet  woman! he?” “yes, sir.” “and teh woman’s name?” “i can’t giv u teh name, sir, but i can giv u teh initials. her initials wuz l. l.” “how doez u knoe this, barrymore?” “well, sir henry, ur uncle had  lettr dat morning. he had usually  great lotz da letters, 4 he wuz  public man an well known 4 hims kind heart, so dat evryone hoo wuz in trouble wuz glad 2 turn 2 him. but dat morning, as it chanced, thar wuz only dis wan letter, so i took teh moar notice ov it. it wuz frum coombe tracey, an it wuz addressed in  woman’s hand.” “well?” “well, sir, i thot no moar ov teh matter, an nevr wud has dun had it not been 4 mah wife. only  few weekz ago she wuz cleaning out sir charles’s study—it had nevr been touched since hims death—and she findz teh ashes ov  burnd lettr in teh bak ov teh grate. the greatr part ov it wuz charred 2 pieces, but wan lil slip, teh end ov  page, hung together, an teh writin cud still bees read, though it wuz grey on  black ground. it seemd 2 us 2 bees  postscript at teh end ov teh lettr an it said: ‘please, please, as u r  gentleman, burn dis letter, an bees at teh gate by ten o clock. beneath it wuz signed teh initials l. l.” “have u got dat slip?” “no, sir, it crumbled all 2 bits aftr we movd it.” “had sir charles receivd any othr letterz in teh same writing?” “well, sir, i took no particular notice ov hims letters. i shud not has noticd dis one, only it happend 2 come alone.” “and u has no idea hoo l. l. is?” “no, sir. no moar than u have. but i expect if we cud lay r hanz upon dat lady we shud knoe moar bout sir charles’s death.” “i cannot understand, barrymore, how u came 2 conceal dis important information.” “well, sir, it wuz immediately aftr dat r own trouble came 2 us. and then again, sir, we wuz both ov us vary fond ov sir charles, as we well might bees considerin all dat he has dun 4 us. to rake dis up couldn’t halp r poor master, an it’s well 2 go carefully when there’s  lady in teh case. even teh best ov us—” “you thot it might injure hims reputation?” “well, sir, i thot no gud cud come ov it. but nao u has been kind 2 us, an i feelz as if it wud bees treating u unfairly not 2 tell u all dat i knoe bout teh matter.” “very good, barrymore; u can go.” when teh butler had left us sir henry turnd 2 me. “well, watson, wut doez u finks ov dis nu light?” “it seemz 2 leef teh darkness rathr blacker than before.” “so i think. but if we can only trace l. l. it shud clear up teh whole business. we has gained dat much. we knoe dat thar iz someone hoo has teh facts if we can only find her. what doez u finks we shud do?” “let holmes knoe all bout it at once. it will giv him teh clue 4 which he has been seeking. i am mutch mistaken if it doez not brin him down.” i went at once 2 mah room an drew up mah report ov teh morning’s conversashun 4 holmes. it wuz evident 2 me dat he had been vary busy ov late, 4 teh notez which i had frum baker street wuz few an short, wif no commentz upon teh informashun which i had supplid an hardly any reference 2 mah mission. no doubt hims blackmailing case iz absorbing all hims faculties. and yet dis nu factor must surely arrest hims attenshun an renew hims interest. i wish dat he wuz here. _october_ 17_th_.—all dai todai teh rain poured down, rustling on teh ivy an dripping frum teh eaves. i thot ov teh convict out upon teh bleak, cold, shelterless moor. poor devil! whatever hims crimes, he has suffered somethin 2 atone 4 them. and then i thot ov dat othr one—the face in teh cab, teh figure against teh moon. was he also out in dat deluged—the unseen watcher, teh man ov darkness? in teh evening i put on mah waterproof an i walked far upon teh sodden moor, fol ov dark imaginings, teh rain beating upon mah face an teh wind whistling bout mah ears. god halp dose hoo wander into teh great mire now, 4 even teh firm uplands r becoming  morass. i findz teh black tor upon which i had seen teh solitary watcher, an frum itz craggy summit i lookd out myself acros teh melancholy downs. rain squalls drifted acros der russet face, an teh heavy, slate-coloured clouds hung low ovar teh landscape, trailing in grey wreaths down teh sides ov teh fantastic hills. in teh distant hollow on teh left, haf hidden by teh mist, teh 2 thin towers ov baskerville hall rose above teh trees. they wuz teh only signz ov human life which i cud see, save only dose prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon teh slopes ov teh hills. nowhere wuz thar any trace ov dat lonely man whom i had seen on teh same spot 2 nights before. as i walked bak i wuz overtaken by dr. mortimer drivin in hims dog-cart ovar  rough moorland track which led frum teh outlying farmhouse ov foulmire. he has been vary attentive 2 us, an hardly  dai has passed dat he has not calld at teh hall 2 c how we wuz gettin on. he insisted upon mah climbing into hims dog-cart, an he gaev me  lift homeward. i findz him mutch troubld ovar teh disappearance ov hims lil spaniel. it had wandered on 2 teh moor an had nevr come back. i gaev him such consolation as i might, but i thot ov teh pony on teh grimpen mire, an i doez not fancy dat he will c hims lil dog again. “by teh way, mortimer,” sed i as we jolted along teh rough road, “i suppose thar r few peeps livin within drivin distance ov dis whom u doez not know?” “hardly any, i think.” “can you, then, tell me teh naym ov any woman whose initials r l. l.?” he thot 4  few minutes. “no,” sed he. “there r  few gipsies an labouring folk 4 whom i can’t answer, but among teh farmers or gentry thar iz no wan whose initials r those. wait  bit though,” he addd aftr  pause. “there iz laura lyons—her initials r l. l.—but she lives in coombe tracey.” “who iz she?” i asked. “she iz frankland’s daughter.” “what! old frankland teh crank?” “exactly. she married an artist namd lyons, hoo came sketchin on teh moor. he proved 2 bees  blackguard an deserted her. the fault frum wut i hear cud not has been entirely on wan side. her father refused 2 has anythin 2 doez wif her cuz she had married without hims consent an perhapz 4 wan or 2 othr reasonz as well. so, tween teh old sinner an teh young wan teh gurl has had  pritee bad time.” “how doez she live?” “i fancy old frankland allowz her  pittance, but it cannot bees more, 4 hims own affairs r considerably involved. whatever she cud has deservd wan cud not allow her 2 go hopelesly 2 teh bad. her story got about, an several ov teh peeps her did somethin 2 enable her 2 earn an honest living. stapleton did 4 one, an sir charles 4 another. i gaev  trifle myself. it wuz 2 set her up in  typewriting business.” he wantd 2 knoe teh object ov mah inquiries, but i managed 2 satisfy hims curiosity without tellin him 2 much, 4 thar iz no reason y we shud taek anyone into r confidence. tomorrow mornin i shall find mah wai 2 coombe tracey, an if i can c dis mrs. laura lyons, ov equivocal reputation,  long step will has been made towardz clearing wan incident in dis chain ov mysteries. i am certainly developin teh wisdom ov teh serpent, 4 when mortimer pressed hims queshuns 2 an inconvenient extent i askd him casually 2 wut type frankland’s skull belonged, an so herd nothin but craniology 4 teh rest ov r drive. i has not lived 4 yeers wif sherlock holmes 4 nothing. i has only wan othr incident 2 record upon dis tempestuous an melancholy day. this wuz mah conversashun wif barrymore jus now, which givez me wan moar strong card which i can play in due time. mortimer had stayed 2 dinner, an he an teh baronet playd écarté afterwards. the butler brought me mah coffee into teh library, an i took teh chance 2 ask him  few questions. “well,” sed i, “has dis preshus relation ov urz departed, or iz he still lurking out yonder?” “i don’t know, sir. i hope 2 heaven dat he has gone, 4 he has brought nothin but trouble here! i’ve not herd ov him since i left out food 4 him last, an dat wuz 3 dais ago.” “did u c him then?” “no, sir, but teh food wuz gone when next i went dat way.” “then he wuz certainly there?” “so u wud think, sir, unles it wuz teh othr man hoo took it.” i sat wif mah coffee-cup halfway 2 mah lips an stared at barrymore. “you knoe dat thar iz anothr man then?” “yes, sir; thar iz anothr man upon teh moor.” “have u seen him?” “no, sir.” “how doez u knoe ov him then?” “selden told me ov him, sir,  week ago or more. he’s in hiding, too, but he’s not  convict as far as i can mak out. i don’t liek it, dr. watson—i tell u straight, sir, dat i don’t liek it.” he spoke wif  sudden passion ov earnestness. “now, listen 2 me, barrymore! i has no interest in dis mattr but dat ov ur master. i has come her wif no object except 2 halp him. tell me, frankly, wut it iz dat u don’t like.” barrymore hesitated 4  moment, as if he regretted hims outburst or findz it difficult 2 expres hims own feelings in words. “it’s all thees goings-on, sir,” he cried at last, waving hims hand towardz teh rain-lashed window which faced teh moor. “there’s foul play somewhere, an there’s black villainy brewing, 2 dat i’ll swear! very glad i shud be, sir, 2 c sir henry on hims wai bak 2 london again!” “but wut iz it dat alarms you?” “look at sir charles’s death! that wuz bad enough, 4 all dat teh coroner said. look at teh noises on teh moor at night. there’s not  man wud cross it aftr sundown if he wuz paid 4 it. look at dis stranger hiding out yonder, an watchin an waiting! what’s he waitin for? what doez it mean? it meanz no gud 2 anyone ov teh naym ov baskerville, an vary glad i shall bees 2 bees quit ov it all on teh dai dat sir henry’s nu servants r ready 2 taek ovar teh hall.” “but bout dis stranger,” sed i. “can u tell me anythin bout him? what did selden say? did he find out wer he hid, or wut he wuz doing?” “he saw him once or twice, but he iz  deep wan an givez nothin away. at furst he thot dat he wuz teh police, but soon he findz dat he had sum lay ov hims own. a kind ov gentleman he was, as far as he cud see, but wut he wuz doin he cud not mak out.” “and wer did he sai dat he lived?” “among teh old houses on teh hillside—the stone huts wer teh old folk usd 2 live.” “but how bout hims food?” “selden findz out dat he has got  lad hoo werkz 4 him an bringz all he needs. i dare sai he goez 2 coombe tracey 4 wut he wants.” “very good, barrymore. we cud talk furthr ov dis sum othr time.” when teh butler had gone i walked ovar 2 teh black window, an i lookd thru  blurred pane at teh drivin clouds an at teh tossing outline ov teh wind-swept trees. it iz  wild night indoors, an wut must it bees in  stone hut upon teh moor. what passion ov hatred can it bees which leads  man 2 lurk in such  place at such  time! and wut deep an earnest purpose can he has which callz 4 such  trial! there, in dat hut upon teh moor, seemz 2 lie teh vary centre ov dat problem which has vexed me so sorely. i swear dat anothr dai shall not has passed b4 i has dun all dat man can doez 2 reach teh heart ov teh mystery. chapter 11. the man on teh tor the extract frum mah private diary which formz teh last chapter has brought mah narrative up 2 teh eighteenth ov october,  tiem when thees strange eventz began 2 moov swiftly towardz der terrible conclusion. the incidents ov teh next few dais r indelibly graven upon mah recollection, an i can tell them without reference 2 teh notez made at teh time. i start them frum teh dai which succeeded dat upon which i had establishd 2 facts ov great importance, teh wan dat mrs. laura lyons ov coombe tracey had writteh 2 sir charles baskerville an made an appointment wif him at teh vary place an hour dat he met hims death, teh othr dat teh lurking man upon teh moor wuz 2 bees findz among teh stone huts upon teh hillside. with thees 2 facts in mah posesshun i felt dat eithr mah intelligence or mah courage must bees deficient if i cud not throw sum furthr light upon thees dark places. i had no opportunity 2 tell teh baronet wut i had learnd bout mrs. lyons upon teh evening before, 4 dr. mortimer remained wif him at cards til it wuz vary late. at breakfast, however, i informd him bout mah discovery an askd him whethr he wud care 2 accompany me 2 coombe tracey. at furst he wuz vary eager 2 come, but on second thoughtz it seemd 2 both ov us dat if i went alone teh resultz might bees better. the moar formal we made teh visit teh les informashun we might obtain. i left sir henry behind, therefore, not without sum prickings ov conscience, an drove off upon mah nu quest. when i reachd coombe tracey i told perkins 2 put up teh horses, an i made inquiries 4 teh lady whom i had come 2 interrogate. i had no difficulty in findin her rooms, which wuz central an well appointed. a maid showd me in without ceremony, an as i entered teh sitting-room  lady, hoo wuz sitting b4  remington typewriter, sprang up wif  pleasant smile ov welcome. her face fell, however, when she saw dat i wuz  stranger, an she sat down again an askd me teh object ov mah visit. the furst impression left by mrs. lyons wuz wan ov extreme beauty. her eyes an hair wuz ov teh same rich hazel colour, an her cheeks, though considerably freckled, wuz flushed wif teh exquisite bloom ov teh brunette, teh dainty pink which lurks at teh heart ov teh sulphur rose. admiration was, i repeat, teh furst impression. but teh second wuz criticism. there wuz somethin subtly wrong wif teh face, sum coarseness ov expression, sum hardness, perhaps, ov eye, sum looseness ov lip which marred itz perfik beauty. but these, ov course, r afterthoughts. at teh moment i wuz simply conscious dat i wuz in teh presence ov  vary handsome woman, an dat she wuz askin me teh reasonz 4 mah visit. i had not quite understood til dat instant how delicate mah mishun was. “i has teh pleasure,” sed i, “of knowing ur father.” it wuz  clumsy introduction, an teh lady made me feelz it. “there iz nothin in common tween mah father an me,” she said. “i owe him nothing, an hims frenz r not mine. if it wuz not 4 teh late sir charles baskerville an sum othr kind hearts i might has starved 4 all dat mah father cared.” “it wuz bout teh late sir charles baskerville dat i has come her 2 c you.” the freckles startd out on teh lady’s face. “what can i tell u bout him?” she asked, an her fingerz playd nervously ovar teh stops ov her typewriter. “you knew him, did u not?” “i has already sed dat i owe  great deal 2 hims kindness. if i am able 2 support myself it iz largely due 2 teh interest which he took in mah unhappy situation.” “did u correspond wif him?” the lady lookd quickly up wif an angry gleam in her hazel eyes. “what iz teh object ov thees questions?” she askd sharply. “the object iz 2 avoid  public scandal. it iz bettr dat i shud ask them her than dat teh mattr shud pas outside r control.” she wuz silent an her face wuz still vary pale. at last she lookd up wif somethin reckless an defiant in her manner. “well, i’ll answer,” she said. “what r ur questions?” “did u correspond wif sir charles?” “i certainly wrote 2 him once or twice 2 acknowledge hims delicacy an hims generosity.” “have u teh dates ov dose letters?” “no.” “have u evr met him?” “yes, once or twice, when he came into coombe tracey. he wuz  vary retiring man, an he preferrd 2 doez gud by stealth.” “but if u saw him so seldom an wrote so seldom, how did he knoe enough bout ur affairs 2 bees able 2 halp you, as u sai dat he has done?” she met mah difficulty wif teh utmost readiness. “there wuz several gentlemen hoo knew mah sad history an unitd 2 halp me. one wuz mr. stapleton,  neighbour an intimate frend ov sir charles’s. he wuz exceedingly kind, an it wuz thru him dat sir charles learnd bout mah affairs.” i knew already dat sir charles baskerville had made stapleton hims almoner upon several occasions, so teh lady’s statement bore teh impress ov truth upon it. “did u evr rite 2 sir charles askin him 2 meet you?” i continued. mrs. lyons flushed wif anger again. “really, sir, dis iz  vary extraordinary question.” “i am sorry, madam, but i must repeat it.” “then i answer, certainly not.” “not on teh vary dai ov sir charles’s death?” the flush had faded in an instant, an  deathly face wuz b4 me. her dry lips cud not speak teh “no” which i saw rathr than heard. “surely ur mems deceives you,” sed i. “i cud even quote  passage ov ur letter. it ran ‘please, please, as u r  gentleman, burn dis letter, an bees at teh gate by ten o’clock.’” i thot dat she had fainted, but she recovered herself by  supreme effort. “is thar no such ting as  gentleman?” she gasped. “you doez sir charles an injustice. he _did_ burn teh letter. but sometimez  lettr cud bees legible even when burned. you acknowledge nao dat u wrote it?” “yes, i did rite it,” she cried, pouring out her soul in  torrent ov words. “i did rite it. why shud i deny it? i has no reason 2 bees ashamed ov it. i wishd him 2 halp me. i believed dat if i had an interview i cud gain hims help, so i askd him 2 meet me.” “but y at such an hour?” “because i had only jus learnd dat he wuz goin 2 london next dai an might bees away 4 months. there wuz reasonz y i cud not git thar earlier.” “but y  rendezvous in teh garden instead ov  visit 2 teh house?” “do u finks  woman cud go alone at dat hour 2  bachelor’s house?” “well, wut happend when u did git there?” “i nevr went.” “mrs. lyons!” “no, i swear it 2 u on all i hold sacred. i nevr went. something intervened 2 prevent mah going.” “what wuz that?” “that iz  private matter. i cannot tell it.” “you acknowledge then dat u made an appointment wif sir charles at teh vary hour an place at which he met hims death, but u deny dat u kept teh appointment.” “that iz teh truth.” again an again i cross-questioned her, but i cud nevr git past dat point. “mrs. lyons,” sed i as i rose frum dis long an inconclusive interview, “you r takin  vary great responsibility an puttin yourself in  vary false posishun by not makin an absolutely clean breast ov all dat u know. if i has 2 call in teh aid ov teh police u will find how srsly u r compromised. if ur posishun iz innocent, y did u in teh furst instance deny havin writteh 2 sir charles upon dat date?” “because i feared dat sum false conclushun might bees drawn frum it an dat i might find myself involvd in  scandal.” “and y wuz u so pressin dat sir charles shud destroy ur letter?” “if u has read teh lettr u will know.” “i did not sai dat i had read all teh letter.” “you quoted sum ov it.” “i quoted teh postscript. the lettr had, as i said, been burnd an it wuz not all legible. i ask u once again y it wuz dat u wuz so pressin dat sir charles shud destroy dis lettr which he receivd on teh dai ov hims death.” “the mattr iz  vary private one.” “the moar reason y u shud avoid  public investigation.” “i will tell you, then. if u has herd anythin ov mah unhappy history u will knoe dat i made  rash marriage an had reason 2 regret it.” “i has herd so much.” “my life has been wan incessant persecution frum  husband whom i abhor. the law iz upon hims side, an evry dai i am faced by teh possibility dat he cud force me 2 liv wif him. at teh tiem dat i wrote dis lettr 2 sir charles i had learnd dat thar wuz  prospect ov mah regaining mah freedom if certain expenses cud bees met. it meant everythin 2 me—peace ov mind, happiness, self-respect—everything. i knew sir charles’s generosity, an i thot dat if he herd teh story frum mah own lips he wud halp me.” “then how iz it dat u did not go?” “because i receivd halp in teh interval frum anothr source.” “why then, did u not rite 2 sir charles an explain this?” “so i shud has dun had i not seen hims death in teh papr next morning.” the woman’s story hung coherently together, an all mah queshuns wuz unable 2 shake it. i cud only check it by findin if she had, indeed, instituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or bout teh tiem ov teh tragedy. it wuz unlikely dat she wud dare 2 sai dat she had not been 2 baskerville hall if she rly had been, 4  trap wud bees necessary 2 taek her there, an cud not has returned 2 coombe tracey til teh early hourz ov teh morning. such an excursion cud not bees kept secret. the probability was, therefore, dat she wuz tellin teh truth, or, at least,  part ov teh truth. i came away baffld an disheartened. once again i had reachd dat ded wall which seemd 2 bees built acros evry path by which i trid 2 git at teh object ov mah mission. and yet teh moar i thot ov teh lady’s face an ov her manner teh moar i felt dat somethin wuz bein held bak frum me. why shud she turn so pale? why shud she fight against evry admishun til it wuz forcd frum her? why shud she has been so reticent at teh tiem ov teh tragedy? surely teh explanashun ov all dis cud not bees as innosent as she wud has me believe. for teh moment i cud proced no farther in dat direction, but must turn bak 2 dat othr clue which wuz 2 bees sought 4 among teh stone huts upon teh moor. and dat wuz  most vague direction. i realised it as i drove bak an noted how hill aftr hill showd traces ov teh ancient people. barrymore’s only indication had been dat teh stranger lived in wan ov thees abandoned huts, an lotz da hundredz ov them r scattered throughout teh length an breadth ov teh moor. but i had mah own experience 4  guide since it had shown me teh man him standing upon teh summit ov teh black tor. that, then, shud bees teh centre ov mah search. from thar i shud explore evry hut upon teh moor til i lighted upon teh rite one. if dis man wuz inside it i shud find out frum hims own lips, at teh point ov mah revolver if necessary, hoo he wuz an y he had doggd us so long. he might slip away frum us in teh crowd ov regent street, but it wud puzzle him 2 doez so upon teh lonely moor. on teh othr hand, if i shud find teh hut an itz tenant shud not bees within it i must remain there, howevr long teh vigil, til he returned. holmes had misd him in london. it wud inded bees  triumph 4 me if i cud run him 2 earth wer mah master had failed. luck had been against us again an again in dis inquiry, but nao at last it came 2 mah aid. and teh messengr ov gud fortune wuz none othr than mr. frankland, hoo wuz standing, grey-whiskered an red-faced, outside teh gate ov hims garden, which opened on 2 teh highroad along which i travelled. “good-day, dr. watson,” cried he wif unwonted gud humour, “you must rly giv ur horses  rest an come in 2 has  glass ov wine an 2 congratulate me.” my feelings towardz him wuz vary far frum bein friendly aftr wut i had herd ov hims treatment ov hims daughter, but i wuz anxious 2 send perkins an teh wagonette home, an teh opportunity wuz  gud one. i alighted an sent  mesage 2 sir henry dat i shud walk ovar in tiem 4 dinner. then i followed frankland into hims dining-room. “it iz  great dai 4 me, sir—one ov teh red-letter dais ov mah life,” he cried wif lotz da chuckles. “i has brought off  double event. i mean 2 teach them in thees partz dat law iz law, an dat thar iz  man her hoo doez not fear 2 invoke it. i has establishd  rite ov wai thru teh centre ov old middleton’s park, slap acros it, sir, within  hundrd yardz ov hims own frunt door. what doez u finks ov that? we’ll teach thees magnates dat they cannot ride roughshod ovar teh rights ov teh commoners, confound them! and i’ve closed teh wood wer teh fernworthy folk usd 2 picnic. these infernal peeps seem 2 finks dat thar r no rights ov property, an dat they can swarm wer they liek wif der papers an der bottles. both cases decided, dr. watson, an both in mah favour. i haven’t had such  dai since i had sir john morland 4 trespass cuz he shot in hims own warren.” “how on earth did u doez that?” “look it up in teh books, sir. it will repay reading—frankland _v_. morland, court ov queen’s bench. it cost me £200, but i got mah verdict.” “did it doez u any good?” “none, sir, none. i am proud 2 sai dat i had no interest in teh matter. i act entirely frum  sense ov public duty. i has no doubt, 4 example, dat teh fernworthy peeps will burn me in effigy tonight. i told teh police last tiem they did it dat they shud stop thees disgraceful exhibitions. the county constabulary iz in  scandalous state, sir, an it has not afforded me teh protection 2 which i am entitled. the case ov frankland _v_. regina will brin teh mattr b4 teh attenshun ov teh public. i told them dat they wud has occasion 2 regret der treatment ov me, an already mah werdz has come true.” “how so?” i asked. the old man put on  vary knowing expression. “because i cud tell them wut they r dying 2 know; but nothin wud induce me 2 halp teh rascals in any way.” i had been casting round 4 sum excuse by which i cud git away frum hims gossip, but nao i began 2 wish 2 hear moar ov it. i had seen enough ov teh contrary nachur ov teh old sinner 2 understand dat any strong sign ov interest wud bees teh surest wai 2 stop hims confidences. “some poaching case, no doubt?” sed i wif an indifferent manner. “ha, ha, mah boy,  vary mutch moar important mattr than that! what bout teh convict on teh moor?” i stared. “you don’t mean dat u knoe wer he is?” sed i. “i cud not knoe egsaktly wer he is, but i am quite sure dat i cud halp teh police 2 lay der hanz on him. has it nevr struck u dat teh wai 2 catch dat man wuz 2 find out wer he got hims food an so trace it 2 him?” he certainly seemd 2 bees gettin uncomfortably near teh truth. “no doubt,” sed i; “but how doez u knoe dat he iz anywhere upon teh moor?” “i knoe it cuz i has seen wif mah own eyes teh messengr hoo takez him hims food.” my heart sank 4 barrymore. it wuz  serious ting 2 bees in teh powr ov dis spiteful old busybody. but hims next remark took  weight frum mah mind. “you’ll bees surprisd 2 hear dat hims food iz taken 2 him by  child. i c him evry dai thru mah telescope upon teh roof. he pasez along teh same path at teh same hour, an 2 whom shud he bees goin except 2 teh convict?” here wuz luck indeed! and yet i suppressed all appearance ov interest. a child! barrymore had sed dat r unknown wuz supplid by  boy. it wuz on hims track, an not upon teh convict’s, dat frankland had stumbled. if i cud git hims knowledge it might save me  long an weary hunt. but incredulity an indifference wuz evidently mah strongest cards. “i shud sai dat it wuz mutch moar likely dat it wuz teh son ov wan ov teh moorland shepherds takin out hims father’s dinner.” the least appearance ov opposition struck fire out ov teh old autocrat. his eyes lookd malignantly at me, an hims grey whiskers bristled liek dose ov an angry cat. “indeed, sir!” sed he, pointin out ovar teh wide-stretching moor. “do u c dat black tor ovar yonder? well, doez u c teh low hill beyond wif teh thornbush upon it? it iz teh stoniest part ov teh whole moor. is dat  place wer  shepherd wud bees likely 2 taek hims station? your suggestion, sir, iz  most absurd one.” i meekly anzwerd dat i had spoken without knowing all teh facts. my submission pleased him an led him 2 furthr confidences. “you cud bees sure, sir, dat i has vary gud groundz b4 i come 2 an opinion. i has seen teh boi again an again wif hims bundle. every day, an sometimez twice  day, i has been able—but wait  moment, dr. watson. do mah eyes deceive me, or iz thar at teh present moment somethin movin upon dat hillside?” it wuz several miles off, but i cud distinctly c  small dark dot against teh dull green an grey. “come, sir, come!” cried frankland, rushing upstairs. “you will c wif ur own eyes an judge 4 yourself.” the telescope,  formidable instrument mounted upon  tripod, stood upon teh flat leads ov teh house. frankland clapped hims eye 2 it an gaev  cry ov satisfaction. “quick, dr. watson, quick, b4 he pasez ovar teh hill!” there he was, sure enough,  small urchin wif  lil bundle upon hims shoulder, toiling slowly up teh hill. when he reachd teh crest i saw teh ragged uncouth figure outlined 4 an instant against teh cold blue sky. he lookd round him wif  furtive an stealthy air, as wan hoo dreads pursuit. then he vanished ovar teh hill. “well! am i right?” “certainly, thar iz  boi hoo seemz 2 has sum seekret errand.” “and wut teh errand iz even  county constable cud guess. but not wan werd shall they has frum me, an i bind u 2 secrecy also, dr. watson. not  word! you understand!” “just as u wish.” “they has treatd me shamefully—shamefully. when teh facts come out in frankland _v_. regina i venture 2 finks dat  thrill ov indignation will run thru teh country. nothing wud induce me 2 halp teh police in any way. for all they cared it might has been me, instead ov mah effigy, which thees rascals burnd at teh stake. surely u r not going! you will halp me 2 empty teh decanter in honour ov dis great occasion!” but i resisted all hims solicitations an succeeded in dissuading him frum hims announcd intention ov walking home wif me. i kept teh road as long as hims eye wuz on me, an then i struck off acros teh moor an made 4 teh stony hill ovar which teh boi had disappeared. everything wuz werkin in mah favour, an i swore dat it shud not bees thru lack ov energy or perseverance dat i shud mis teh chance which fortune had thrown in mah way. the sun wuz already sinkin when i reachd teh summit ov teh hill, an teh long slopes beneath me wuz all golden-green on wan side an grey shadow on teh other. a haze lay low upon teh farthest sky-line, out ov which jutted teh fantastic shapes ov belliver an vixen tor. over teh wide expanse thar wuz no sound an no movement. one great grey bird,  gull or curlew, soared aloft in teh blue heaven. he an i seemd 2 bees teh only livin tings tween teh huge arch ov teh sky an teh desert beneath it. the barren scene, teh sense ov loneliness, an teh mystery an urgency ov mah task all struck  chill into mah heart. the boi wuz nowhere 2 bees seen. but down beneath me in  cleft ov teh hills thar wuz  circle ov teh old stone huts, an in teh middle ov them thar wuz wan which retaind sufficient roof 2 act as  screen against teh weather. my heart leaped within me as i saw it. this must bees teh burrow wer teh stranger lurked. at last mah foot wuz on teh threshold ov hims hiding place—his seekret wuz within mah grasp. as i approached teh hut, walking as warily as stapleton wud doez when wif poised net he drew near teh settled butterfly, i satisfied myself dat teh place had inded been usd as  habitation. a vague pathway among teh boulders led 2 teh dilapidated openin which servd as  door. all wuz silent within. the unknown might bees lurking there, or he might bees prowling on teh moor. my nerves tingled wif teh sense ov adventure. throwing aside mah cigarette, i closed mah hand upon teh butt ov mah revolver and, walking swiftly up 2 teh door, i lookd in. the place wuz empty. but thar wuz ample signz dat i had not come upon  false scent. this wuz certainly wer teh man lived. some blankets rolled in  waterproof lay upon dat vary stone slab upon which neolithic man had once slumbered. the ashes ov  fire wuz heaped in  rude grate. beside it lay sum cooking utensils an  bucket half-full ov water. a litter ov empty tins showd dat teh place had been occupied 4 sum time, an i saw, as mah eyes became accustomd 2 teh checkered light,  pannikin an  half-full bottle ov spirits standing in teh corner. in teh middle ov teh hut  flat stone servd teh purpose ov  table, an upon dis stood  small cloth bundle—the same, no doubt, which i had seen thru teh telescope upon teh shoulder ov teh boy. it contained  loaf ov bread,  tinned tongue, an 2 tins ov preserved peaches. as i set it down again, aftr havin examined it, mah heart leaped 2 c dat beneath it thar lay  sheet ov papr wif writin upon it. i raisd it, an dis wuz wut i read, roughly scrawled in pencil: “dr. watson has gone 2 coombe tracey.” for  minute i stood thar wif teh papr in mah hanz thinkin out teh meanin ov dis curt message. it wuz i, then, an not sir henry, hoo wuz bein doggd by dis seekret man. he had not followed me himself, but he had set an agent—the boy, perhaps—upon mah track, an dis wuz hims report. possibly i had taken no step since i had been upon teh moor which had not been observed an reported. always thar wuz dis feelin ov an unseen force,  fine net drawn round us wif infinite skill an delicacy, holdin us so lightly dat it wuz only at sum supreme moment dat wan realised dat wan wuz inded entangled in itz meshes. if thar wuz wan report thar might bees others, so i lookd round teh hut in search ov them. there wuz no trace, however, ov anythin ov teh kind, nor cud i discover any sign which might indicate teh character or intenshuns ov teh man hoo lived in dis singular place, save dat he must bees ov spartan habits an cared lil 4 teh comforts ov life. when i thot ov teh heavy rains an lookd at teh gapin roof i understood how strong an immutable must bees teh purpose which had kept him in dat inhospitable abode. was he r malignant enemy, or wuz he by chance r guardian angel? i swore dat i wud not leef teh hut til i knew. outside teh sun wuz sinkin low an teh west wuz blazing wif scarlet an gold. its reflection wuz shot bak in ruddy patches by teh distant pools which lay amid teh great grimpen mire. there wuz teh 2 towers ov baskerville hall, an thar  distant blur ov smoke which marked teh village ov grimpen. between teh two, behind teh hill, wuz teh houz ov teh stapletons. all wuz sweet an mellow an peaceful in teh golden evening light, an yet as i lookd at them mah soul shard none ov teh peace ov nature but quivered at teh vagueness an teh terror ov dat interview which evry instant wuz bringin nearer. with tingling nerves but  fixd purpose, i sat in teh dark recess ov teh hut an waited wif sombre patience 4 teh comin ov itz tenant. and then at last i herd him. far away came teh sharp clink ov  boot strikin upon  stone. then anothr an yet another, comin nearer an nearer. i shrank bak into teh darkest corner an cocked teh pistol in mah pocket, determind not 2 discover myself til i had an opportunity ov seein somethin ov teh stranger. there wuz  long pause which showd dat he had stopped. then once moar teh footsteps approached an  shadow fell acros teh openin ov teh hut. “it iz  luvly evening, mah dear watson,” sed  well-known voice. “i rly finks dat u will bees moar comfortable outside than in.” chapter 12. death on teh moor for  moment or 2 i sat breathless, hardly able 2 bleev mah ears. then mah senses an mah voice came bak 2 me, while  crushing weight ov responsibility seemd in an instant 2 bees lifted frum mah soul. that cold, incisive, ironical voice cud belong 2 but wan man in all teh world. “holmes!” i cried—“holmes!” “come out,” sed he, “and plz bees careful wif teh revolver.” i stooped undr teh rude lintel, an thar he sat upon  stone outside, hims grey eyes dancing wif amusement as they fell upon mah astonished features. he wuz thin an worn, but clear an alert, hims keen face bronzed by teh sun an roughened by teh wind. in hims tweed suit an cloth cap he lookd liek any othr tourist upon teh moor, an he had contrived, wif dat catlike luv ov personal cleanliness which wuz wan ov hims characteristics, dat hims chin shud bees as smooth an hims linen as perfik as if he wuz in baker street. “i nevr wuz moar glad 2 c anyone in mah life,” sed i as i wrung him by teh hand. “or moar astonished, eh?” “well, i must confess 2 it.” “the surprise wuz not all on wan side, i assure you. i had no idea dat u had findz mah occashunal retreat, still les dat u wuz inside it, til i wuz within twenty paces ov teh door.” “my footprint, i presume?” “no, watson, i fear dat i cud not undertake 2 recognize ur footprint amid all teh footprints ov teh world. if u srsly desire 2 deceive me u must change ur tobacconist; 4 when i c teh stub ov  cigarette marked bradley, oxford street, i knoe dat mah frend watson iz in teh neighbourhood. you will c it thar beside teh path. you threw it down, no doubt, at dat supreme moment when u chargd into teh empty hut.” “exactly.” “i thot as much—and knowing ur admirable tenacity i wuz convincd dat u wuz sitting in ambush,  weapon within reach, waitin 4 teh tenant 2 return. so u akshully thot dat i wuz teh criminal?” “i did not knoe hoo u were, but i wuz determind 2 find out.” “excellent, watson! and how did u localise me? you saw me, perhaps, on teh night ov teh convict hunt, when i wuz so imprudent as 2 allow teh moon 2 rise behind me?” “yes, i saw u then.” “and has no doubt searched all teh huts til u came 2 dis one?” “no, ur boi had been observed, an dat gaev me  guide wer 2 look.” “the old gentleman wif teh telescope, no doubt. i cud not mak it out when furst i saw teh light flashing upon teh lens.” he rose an peeped into teh hut. “ha, i c dat cartwright has brought up sum supplies. what’s dis paper? so u has been 2 coombe tracey, has you?” “yes.” “to c mrs. laura lyons?” “exactly.” “well done! our researches has evidently been runnin on parallel lines, an when we unite r resultz i expect we shall has  fairly fol knowledge ov teh case.” “well, i am glad frum mah heart dat u r here, 4 inded teh responsibility an teh mystery wuz both becoming 2 mutch 4 mah nerves. but how in teh naym ov wondr did u come here, an wut has u been doing? i thot dat u wuz in baker street werkin out dat case ov blackmailing.” “that wuz wut i wishd u 2 think.” “then u use me, an yet doez not trust me!” i cried wif sum bitterness. “i finks dat i has deservd bettr at ur hands, holmes.” “my dear fellow, u has been invaluable 2 me in dis as in lotz da othr cases, an i beg dat u will forgive me if i has seemd 2 play  trick upon you. in truth, it wuz partly 4 ur own sake dat i did it, an it wuz mah appreciation ov teh dangr which u ran which led me 2 come down an examine teh mattr 4 myself. had i been wif sir henry an u it iz confident dat mah point ov view wud has been teh same as yours, an mah presence wud has warnd r vary formidable opponents 2 bees on der guard. as it is, i has been able 2 git bout as i cud not possibly has dun had i been livin in teh hall, an i remain an unknown factor in teh business, ready 2 throw in all mah weight at  critical moment.” “but y keep me in teh dark?” “for u 2 knoe cud not has helpd us an might possibly has led 2 mah discovery. you wud has wishd 2 tell me something, or in ur kindness u wud has brought me out sum comfort or other, an so an unnecessary risk wud bees run. i brought cartwright down wif me—you remembr teh lil chap at teh expres office—and he has seen aftr mah simple wants:  loaf ov bread an  clean collar. what doez man wants more? he has given me an extra pair ov eyes upon  vary active pair ov feet, an both has been invaluable.” “then mah reportz has all been wasted!”—my voice trembled as i recalled teh pains an teh pride wif which i had composed them. holmes took  bundle ov papers frum hims pocket. “here r ur reports, mah dear fellow, an vary well thumbed, i assure you. i made awsum arrangements, an they r only delayed wan dai upon der way. i must compliment u exceedingly upon teh zeal an teh intelligence which u has shown ovar an extraordinarily difficult case.” i wuz still rathr raw ovar teh decepshun which had been practised upon me, but teh warmth ov holmes’s praise drove mah anger frum mah mind. i felt also in mah heart dat he wuz rite in wut he sed an dat it wuz rly best 4 r purpose dat i shud not has known dat he wuz upon teh moor. “that’s better,” sed he, seein teh shadow rise frum mah face. “and nao tell me teh result ov ur visit 2 mrs. laura lyons—it wuz not difficult 4 me 2 gues dat it wuz 2 c her dat u had gone, 4 i am already aware dat she iz teh wan person in coombe tracey hoo might bees ov survis 2 us in teh matter. in fact, if u had not gone todai it iz exceedingly probable dat i shud has gone tomorrow.” the sun had set an dusk wuz settling ovar teh moor. the air had turnd chill an we withdrew into teh hut 4 warmth. there, sitting togehtr in teh twilight, i told holmes ov mah conversashun wif teh lady. so interestd wuz he dat i had 2 repeat sum ov it twice b4 he wuz satisfied. “this iz most important,” sed he when i had concluded. “it fills up  gap which i had been unable 2 bridge in dis most complex affair. you r aware, perhaps, dat  close intimacy existz tween dis lady an teh man stapleton?” “i did not knoe ov  close intimacy.” “there can bees no doubt bout teh matter. they meet, they write, thar iz  complete understandin tween them. now, dis puts  vary powerful weapon into r hands. if i cud only use it 2 detach hims wife—” “his wife?” “i am givin u sum informashun now, in return 4 all dat u has given me. the lady hoo has passed her as miss stapleton iz in reality hims wife.” “good heavens, holmes! are u sure ov wut u say? how cud he has permitted sir henry 2 fall in luv wif her?” “sir henry’s falling in luv cud doez no harm 2 anyone except sir henry. he took particular care dat sir henry did not mak luv 2 her, as u has yourself observed. i repeat dat teh lady iz hims wife an not hims sister.” “but y dis elaborate deception?” “because he foresaw dat she wud bees vary mutch moar useful 2 him in teh character ov  free woman.” all mah unspoken instincts, mah vague suspicions, suddenly took shape an centred upon teh naturalist. in dat impassive colourless man, wif hims straw hat an hims butterfly-net, i seemd 2 c somethin terrible—a creature ov infinite patience an craft, wif  smiling face an  murderous heart. “it iz he, then, hoo iz r enemy—it iz he hoo doggd us in london?” “so i read teh riddle.” “and teh warning—it must has come frum her!” “exactly.” the shape ov sum monstrous villainy, haf seen, haf guessed, loomed thru teh darkness which had girt me so long. “but r u sure ov this, holmes? how doez u knoe dat teh woman iz hims wife?” “because he so far forgot him as 2 tell u  true piece ov autobiography upon teh occasion when he furst met you, an i dare sai he has lotz da  tiem regretted it since. he wuz once  schoolmaster in teh north ov england. now, thar iz no wan moar easy 2 trace than  schoolmaster. there r scholastic agencies by which wan cud identify any man hoo has been in teh profession. a lil investigation showd me dat  school had come 2 grief undr atrocious circumstances, an dat teh man hoo had ownd it—the naym wuz different—had disappeared wif hims wife. the descripshuns agreed. when i learnd dat teh missin man wuz devoted 2 entomology teh identification wuz complete.” the darkness wuz rising, but mutch wuz still hidden by teh shadows. “if dis woman iz in truth hims wife, wer doez mrs. laura lyons come in?” i asked. “that iz wan ov teh pointz upon which ur own researches has shed  light. your interview wif teh lady has cleared teh situashun vary much. i did not knoe bout  projected divorce tween herself an her husband. in dat case, regardin stapleton as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becoming hims wife.” “and when she iz undeceived?” “why, then we cud find teh lady ov service. it must bees r furst duty 2 c her—both ov us—tomorrow. don’t u think, watson, dat u r away frum ur charge rathr long? your place shud bees at baskerville hall.” the last red streaks had faded away in teh west an night had settled upon teh moor. a few faint starz wuz gleaming in  violet sky. “one last question, holmes,” i sed as i rose. “surely thar iz no ned ov secrecy tween u an me. what iz teh meanin ov it all? what iz he after?” holmes’s voice sank as he answered: “it iz murder, watson—refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder. do not ask me 4 particulars. my nets r closin upon him, even as hims r upon sir henry, an wif ur halp he iz already almost at mah mercy. there iz but wan dangr which can threaten us. it iz dat he shud strike b4 we r ready 2 doez so. another day—two at teh most—and i has mah case complete, but til then guard ur charge as closely as evr  fond mothr watched her ailing child. your mishun todai has justified itself, an yet i cud almost wish dat u had not left hims side. hark!” a terrible scream—a prolonged yell ov horror an anguish—burst out ov teh silence ov teh moor. that frightful cry turnd teh blood 2 ice in mah veins. “oh, mah god!” i gasped. “what iz it? what doez it mean?” holmes had sprung 2 hims feet, an i saw hims dark, athletic outline at teh door ov teh hut, hims shoulders stooping, hims hed thrust forward, hims face peering into teh darkness. “hush!” he whispered. “hush!” the cry had been loud on akownt ov itz vehemence, but it had pealed out frum somewhere far off on teh shadowy plain. now it burst upon r ears, nearer, louder, moar urgent than before. “where iz it?” holmes whispered; an i knew frum teh thrill ov hims voice dat he, teh man ov iron, wuz shaken 2 teh soul. “where iz it, watson?” “there, i think.” i pointed into teh darkness. “no, there!” again teh agonised cry swept thru teh silent night, louder an mutch nearer than ever. and  nu sound mingled wif it,  deep, muttered rumble, musical an yet menacing, rising an falling liek teh low, constant murmur ov teh sea. “the hound!” cried holmes. “come, watson, come! great heavens, if we r 2 late!” he had startd runnin swiftly ovar teh moor, an i had followed at hims heels. but nao frum somewhere among teh brokd ground immediately in frunt ov us thar came wan last despairing yell, an then  dull, heavy thud. we halted an listened. not anothr sound broke teh heavy silence ov teh windless night. i saw holmes put hims hand 2 hims forehead liek  man distracted. he stamped hims feet upon teh ground. “he has beaten us, watson. we r 2 late.” “no, no, surely not!” “fool dat i wuz 2 hold mah hand. and you, watson, c wut comez ov abandoning ur charge! but, by heaven, if teh wurst has happend we’ll avenge him!” blindly we ran thru teh gloom, blundering against boulders, forcin r wai thru gorse bushes, panting up hills an rushing down slopes, headin alwayz in teh direcshun whence dose dreadful soundz had come. at evry rise holmes lookd eagerly round him, but teh shadows wuz thick upon teh moor, an nothin movd upon itz dreary face. “can u c anything?” “nothing.” “but, hark, wut iz that?” a low moan had fallen upon r ears. there it wuz again upon r left! on dat side  ridge ov rocks endd in  sheer cliff which overlookd  stone-strewn slope. on itz jagged face wuz spread-eagled sum dark, irregular object. as we ran towardz it teh vague outline hardened into  definite shape. it wuz  prostrate man face downward upon teh ground, teh hed doubld undr him at  horrible angle, teh shoulders rounded an teh body hunched togehtr as if in teh act ov throwin  somersault. so grotesque wuz teh attitude dat i cud not 4 teh instant realise dat dat moan had been teh passing ov hims soul. not  whisper, not  rustle, rose nao frum teh dark figure ovar which we stooped. holmes laid hims hand upon him an held it up again wif an exclamation ov horror. the gleam ov teh match which he struck shone upon hims clotted fingerz an upon teh ghastly pool which widened slowly frum teh crushed skull ov teh victim. and it shone upon somethin else which turnd r hearts sick an faint within us—the body ov sir henry baskerville! there wuz no chance ov eithr ov us forgetting dat peculiar ruddy tweed suit—the vary wan which he had worn on teh furst mornin dat we had seen him in baker street. we caught teh wan clear glimpse ov it, an then teh match flickered an went out, even as teh hope had gone out ov r souls. holmes groaned, an hims face glimmered white thru teh darkness. “the brute! the brute!” i cried wif clenched hands. “oh holmes, i shall nevr forgive myself 4 havin left him 2 hims fate.” “i am moar 2 blame than you, watson. in ordr 2 has mah case well rounded an complete, i has thrown away teh life ov mah client. it iz teh greatest blow which has befallen me in mah career. but how cud i know—how _could_ i know—that he wud risk hims life alone upon teh moor in teh face ov all mah warnings?” “that we shud has herd hims screams—my god, dose screams!—and yet has been unable 2 save him! where iz dis brute ov  hound which drove him 2 hims death? it cud bees lurking among thees rocks at dis instant. and stapleton, wer iz he? he shall anzwr 4 dis deed.” “he shall. i will c 2 that. uncle an nephew has been murdered—the wan frightened 2 death by teh vary sight ov  beast which he thot 2 bees supernatural, teh othr driven 2 hims end in hims wild flight 2 escape frum it. but nao we has 2 prove teh connecshun tween teh man an teh beast. save frum wut we heard, we cannot even swear 2 teh existence ov teh latter, since sir henry has evidently did frum teh fall. but, by heavens, cunning as he is, teh fellow shall bees in mah powr b4 anothr dai iz past!” we stood wif bitter hearts on eithr side ov teh mangled body, overwhelmed by dis sudden an irrevocable disaster which had brought all r long an weary labours 2 so piteous an end. then as teh moon rose we climbed 2 teh top ov teh rocks ovar which r poor frend had fallen, an frum teh summit we gazed out ovar teh shadowy moor, haf silvr an haf gloom. far away, miles off, in teh direcshun ov grimpen,  single steady yellow light wuz shining. it cud only come frum teh lonely abode ov teh stapletons. with  bitter curse i shook mah fist at it as i gazed. “why shud we not seize him at once?” “our case iz not complete. the fellow iz wary an cunning 2 teh last degree. it iz not wut we know, but wut we can prove. if we mak wan false moov teh villain cud escape us yet.” “what can we do?” “there will bees plenty 4 us 2 doez tomorrow. tonight we can only perform teh last offices 2 r poor friend.” together we made r wai down teh precipitous slope an approached teh body, black an clear against teh silvered stones. the agony ov dose contorted limbs struck me wif  spasm ov pain an blurred mah eyes wif tears. “we must send 4 help, holmes! we cannot carry him all teh wai 2 teh hall. good heavens, r u mad?” he had uttered  cry an bent ovar teh body. now he wuz dancing an laughing an wringing mah hand. could dis bees mah stern, self-contained friend? these wuz hidden fires, indeed! “a beard! a beard! the man has  beard!” “a beard?” “it iz not teh baronet—it is—why, it iz mah neighbour, teh convict!” with feverish haste we had turnd teh body over, an dat dripping beard wuz pointin up 2 teh cold, clear moon. there cud bees no doubt bout teh beetling forehead, teh sunken animal eyes. it wuz inded teh same face which had glared upon me in teh light ov teh candle frum ovar teh rock—the face ov selden, teh criminal. then in an instant it wuz all clear 2 me. i remembered how teh baronet had told me dat he had handd hims old wardrobe 2 barrymore. barrymore had passed it on in ordr 2 halp selden in hims escape. boots, shirt, cap—it wuz all sir henry’s. the tragedy wuz still black enough, but dis man had at least deservd death by teh lawz ov hims country. i told holmes how teh mattr stood, mah heart bubbling ovar wif thankfulness an joy. “then teh clothes has been teh poor devil’s death,” sed he. “it iz clear enough dat teh hound has been laid on frum sum article ov sir henry’s—the boot which wuz abstracted in teh hotel, in all probability—and so ran dis man down. there iz wan vary singular thing, however: how came selden, in teh darkness, 2 knoe dat teh hound wuz on hims trail?” “he herd him.” “to hear  hound upon teh moor wud not werk  hard man liek dis convict into such  paroxysm ov terror dat he wud risk recapture by screaming wildly 4 help. by hims cries he must has run  long wai aftr he knew teh animal wuz on hims track. how did he know?” “a greatr mystery 2 me iz y dis hound, presuming dat all r conjectures r correct—” “i presume nothing.” “well, then, y dis hound shud bees loose tonight. i suppose dat it doez not alwayz run loose upon teh moor. stapleton wud not let it go unles he had reason 2 finks dat sir henry wud bees there.” “my difficulty iz teh moar formidable ov teh two, 4 i finks dat we shall vary shortly git an explanashun ov yours, while mine cud remain forever  mystery. the queshun nao is, wut shall we doez wif dis poor wretch’s body? we cannot leef it her 2 teh foxes an teh ravens.” “i suggest dat we put it in wan ov teh huts til we can communicate wif teh police.” “exactly. i has no doubt dat u an i cud carry it so far. halloa, watson, what’s this? it’s teh man himself, by all that’s wonderful an audacious! not  werd 2 show ur suspicions—not  word, or mah planz crumble 2 teh ground.” a figure wuz approaching us ovar teh moor, an i saw teh dull red glow ov  cigar. the moon shone upon him, an i cud distinguish teh dapper shape an jaunty walk ov teh naturalist. he stopped when he saw us, an then came on again. “why, dr. watson, that’s not you, iz it? you r teh last man dat i shud has expectd 2 c out on teh moor at dis tiem ov night. but, dear me, what’s this? somebody hurt? not—don’t tell me dat it iz r frend sir henry!” he hurried past me an stooped ovar teh ded man. i herd  sharp intake ov hims breath an teh cigar fell frum hims fingers. “who—who’s this?” he stammered. “it iz selden, teh man hoo escaped frum princetown.” stapleton turnd  ghastly face upon us, but by  supreme effort he had overcome hims amazement an hims disappointment. he lookd sharply frum holmes 2 me. “dear me! what  vary shockin affair! how did he die?” “he appearz 2 has brokd hims neck by falling ovar thees rocks. my frend an i wuz strolling on teh moor when we herd  cry.” “i herd  cry also. that wuz wut brought me out. i wuz uneasy bout sir henry.” “why bout sir henry in particular?” i cud not halp asking. “because i had suggestd dat he shud come over. when he did not come i wuz surprised, an i naturally became alarmed 4 hims safety when i herd cries upon teh moor. by teh way”—his eyes darted again frum mah face 2 holmes’s—“did u hear anythin else besides  cry?” “no,” sed holmes; “did you?” “no.” “what doez u mean, then?” “oh, u knoe teh storiez dat teh peasants tell bout  phantom hound, an so on. it iz sed 2 bees herd at night upon teh moor. i wuz wonderin if thar wuz any evidence ov such  sound tonight.” “we herd nothin ov teh kind,” sed i. “and wut iz ur theory ov dis poor fellow’s death?” “i has no doubt dat anxiety an exposure has driven him off hims head. he has rushed bout teh moor in  crazy state an evenshully fallen ovar her an brokd hims neck.” “that seemz teh most reasonable theory,” sed stapleton, an he gaev  sigh which i took 2 indicate hims relief. “what doez u finks bout it, mr. sherlock holmes?” my frend bowed hims compliments. “you r quick at identification,” sed he. “we has been expecting u in thees partz since dr. watson came down. you r in tiem 2 c  tragedy.” “yes, indeed. i has no doubt dat mah friend’s explanashun will cover teh facts. i will taek an unpleasant remembrance bak 2 london wif me tomorrow.” “oh, u return tomorrow?” “that iz mah intention.” “i hope ur visit has cast sum light upon dose occurrences which has puzzled us?” holmes shrugged hims shoulders. “one cannot alwayz has teh succes 4 which wan hopes. an investigator needz facts an not legends or rumours. it has not been  satisfactory case.” my frend spoke in hims frankest an most unconcerned manner. stapleton still lookd hard at him. then he turnd 2 me. “i wud suggest carrying dis poor fellow 2 mah house, but it wud giv mah sister such  fright dat i doez not feelz justified in doin it. i finks dat if we put somethin ovar hims face he will bees safe til morning.” and so it wuz arranged. resisting stapleton’s offr ov hospitality, holmes an i set off 2 baskerville hall, leaving teh naturalist 2 return alone. looking bak we saw teh figure movin slowly away ovar teh broad moor, an behind him dat wan black smudge on teh silvered slope which showd wer teh man wuz lyin hoo had come so horribly 2 hims end. “we’re at close grips at last,” sed holmes as we walked togehtr acros teh moor. “what  nerve teh fellow has! how he pulld him togehtr in teh face ov wut must has been  paralyzing shock when he findz dat teh wrong man had fallen  victim 2 hims plot. i told u in london, watson, an i tell u nao again, dat we has nevr had  foeman moar worthy ov r steel.” “i am sry dat he has seen you.” “and so wuz i at first. but thar wuz no gettin out ov it.” “what effect doez u finks it will has upon hims planz nao dat he knowz u r here?” “it cud cause him 2 bees moar cautious, or it cud driv him 2 desperate measurez at once. like most clevr criminals, he cud bees 2 confident in hims own cleverness an imagine dat he has completely deceived us.” “why shud we not arrest him at once?” “my dear watson, u wuz born 2 bees  man ov action. your instinct iz alwayz 2 doez somethin energetic. but supposing, 4 argument’s sake, dat we had him arrested tonight, wut on earth teh bettr off shud we bees 4 that? we cud prove nothin against him. there’s teh devilish cunning ov it! if he wuz acting thru  human agent we cud git sum evidence, but if we wuz 2 drag dis great dog 2 teh light ov dai it wud not halp us in puttin  rope round teh neck ov itz master.” “surely we has  case.” “not  shadow ov one—only surmise an conjecture. we shud bees laughed out ov court if we came wif such  story an such evidence.” “there iz sir charles’s death.” “found ded without  mark upon him. you an i knoe dat he did ov sheer fright, an we knoe also wut frightened him, but how r we 2 git twelve stolid jurymen 2 knoe it? what signz r thar ov  hound? where r teh marks ov itz fangs? of course we knoe dat  hound doez not bite  ded body an dat sir charles wuz ded b4 evr teh brute overtook him. but we has 2 prove all this, an we r not in  posishun 2 doez it.” “well, then, tonight?” “we r not mutch bettr off tonight. again, thar wuz no direct connecshun tween teh hound an teh man’s death. we nevr saw teh hound. we herd it, but we cud not prove dat it wuz runnin upon dis man’s trail. there iz  complete absence ov motive. no, mah dear fellow; we must reconcile ourselves 2 teh fact dat we has no case at present, an dat it iz wurth r while 2 run any risk in ordr 2 establish one.” “and how doez u propose 2 doez so?” “i has great hopes ov wut mrs. laura lyons cud doez 4 us when teh posishun ov affairs iz made clear 2 her. and i has mah own plan as well. sufficient 4 2morrow iz teh evil thereof; but i hope b4 teh dai iz past 2 has teh uppr hand at last.” i cud draw nothin furthr frum him, an he walked, lost in thought, as far as teh baskerville gates. “are u comin up?” “yes; i c no reason 4 furthr concealment. but wan last word, watson. say nothin ov teh hound 2 sir henry. let him finks dat selden’s death wuz as stapleton wud has us believe. he will has  bettr nerve 4 teh ordeal which he will has 2 undergo tomorrow, when he iz engaged, if i remembr ur report aright, 2 dine wif thees people.” “and so am i.” “then u must excuse yourself an he must go alone. that will bees easily arranged. and now, if we r 2 late 4 dinner, i finks dat we r both ready 4 r suppers.” chapter 13. fixing teh nets sir henry wuz moar pleased than surprisd 2 c sherlock holmes, 4 he had 4 sum dais been expecting dat resent eventz wud brin him down frum london. he did raise hims eyebrows, however, when he findz dat mah frend had neithr any luggage nor any explanashuns 4 itz absence. between us we soon supplid hims wants, an then ovar  belated supper we explaind 2 teh baronet as mutch ov r experience as it seemd desirable dat he shud know. but furst i had teh unpleasant duty ov breaking teh newz 2 barrymore an hims wife. to him it cud has been an unmitigated relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. to all teh wurld he wuz teh man ov violence, haf animal an haf demon; but 2 her he alwayz remained teh lil wilful boi ov her own girlhood, teh child hoo had clung 2 her hand. evil inded iz teh man hoo has not wan woman 2 mourn him. “i’ve been moping in teh houz all dai since watson went off in teh morning,” sed teh baronet. “i gues i shud has sum credit, 4 i has kept mah promise. if i hadn’t sworn not 2 go bout alone i might has had  moar lively evening, 4 i had  mesage frum stapleton askin me ovar there.” “i has no doubt dat u wud has had  moar lively evening,” sed holmes drily. “by teh way, i don’t suppose u appreciate dat we has been mourning ovar u as havin brokd ur neck?” sir henry opened hims eyes. “how wuz that?” “this poor wretch wuz dressd in ur clothes. i fear ur servant hoo gaev them 2 him cud git into trouble wif teh police.” “that iz unlikely. there wuz no mark on any ov them, as far as i know.” “that’s lucky 4 him—in fact, it’s lucky 4 all ov you, since u r all on teh wrong side ov teh law in dis matter. i am not sure dat as  conscientious detective mah furst duty iz not 2 arrest teh whole household. watson’s reportz r most incriminating documents.” “but how bout teh case?” askd teh baronet. “have u made anythin out ov teh tangle? i don’t knoe dat watson an i r mutch teh wiser since we came down.” “i finks dat i shall bees in  posishun 2 mak teh situashun rathr moar clear 2 u b4 long. it has been an exceedingly difficult an most complicatd business. there r several pointz upon which we still wants light—but it iz comin all teh same.” “we’ve had wan experience, as watson has no doubt told you. we herd teh hound on teh moor, so i can swear dat it iz not all empty superstition. i had somethin 2 doez wif dogs when i wuz out west, an i knoe wan when i hear one. if u can muzzle dat wan an put him on  chain i’ll bees ready 2 swear u r teh greatest detective ov all time.” “i finks i will muzzle him an chain him all rite if u will giv me ur help.” “whatever u tell me 2 doez i will do.” “very good; an i will ask u also 2 doez it blindly, without alwayz askin teh reason.” “just as u like.” “if u will doez dis i finks teh chances r dat r lil problem will soon bees solved. i has no doubt—” he stopped suddenly an stared fixedly up ovar mah hed into teh air. the lamp beat upon hims face, an so intent wuz it an so still dat it might has been dat ov  clear-cut classical statue,  personification ov alertness an expectation. “what iz it?” we both cried. i cud c as he lookd down dat he wuz repressing sum internal emotion. his featurez wuz still composed, but hims eyes shone wif amused exultation. “excuse teh admiration ov  connoisseur,” sed he as he waved hims hand towardz teh line ov portraits which covered teh opposite wall. “watson won’t allow dat i knoe anythin ov art but dat iz mere jealousy cuz r views upon teh subject differ. now, thees r  rly vary fine seriez ov portraits.” “well, i’m glad 2 hear u sai so,” sed sir henry, glancing wif sum surprise at mah friend. “i don’t pretend 2 knoe mutch bout thees things, an i’d bees  bettr judge ov  horse or  steer than ov  picture. i didn’t knoe dat u findz tiem 4 such things.” “i knoe wut iz gud when i c it, an i c it now. that’s  kneller, i’ll swear, dat lady in teh blue silk ovar yonder, an teh stout gentleman wif teh wig ought 2 bees  reynolds. they r all family portraits, i presume?” “every one.” “do u knoe teh names?” “barrymore has been coaching me in them, an i finks i can sai mah lessons fairly well.” “who iz teh gentleman wif teh telescope?” “that iz rear-admiral baskerville, hoo servd undr rodney in teh west indies. the man wif teh blue coat an teh roll ov papr iz sir william baskerville, hoo wuz chairman ov committees ov teh house ov commons undr pitt.” “and dis cavalier opposite 2 me—the wan wif teh black velvet an teh lace?” “ah, u has  rite 2 knoe bout him. that iz teh cause ov all teh mischief, teh wicked hugo, hoo startd teh hound ov teh baskervilles. we’re not likely 2 forget him.” i gazed wif interest an sum surprise upon teh portrait. “dear me!” sed holmes, “he seemz  quiet, meek-mannered man enough, but i dare sai dat thar wuz  lurking devil in hims eyes. i had pictured him as  moar robust an ruffianly person.” “there’s no doubt bout teh authenticity, 4 teh naym an teh date, 1647, r on teh bak ov teh canvas.” holmes sed lil more, but teh picture ov teh old roysterer seemd 2 has  fascination 4 him, an hims eyes wuz continually fixd upon it durin supper. it wuz not til later, when sir henry had gone 2 hims room, dat i wuz able 2 follow teh trend ov hims thoughts. he led me bak into teh banqueting-hall, hims bedroom candle in hims hand, an he held it up against teh time-stained portrait on teh wall. “do u c anythin there?” i lookd at teh broad plumed hat, teh curling love-locks, teh white lace collar, an teh straight, severe face which wuz framed tween them. it wuz not  brutal countenance, but it wuz prim, hard, an stern, wif  firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, an  coldly intolerant eye. “is it liek anyone u know?” “there iz somethin ov sir henry bout teh jaw.” “just  suggestion, perhaps. but wait an instant!” he stood upon  chair, and, holdin up teh light in hims left hand, he curved hims rite arm ovar teh broad hat an round teh long ringlets. “good heavens!” i cried in amazement. the face ov stapleton had sprung out ov teh canvas. “ha, u c it now. my eyes has been trained 2 examine facez an not der trimmings. it iz teh furst quality ov  criminal investigator dat he shud c thru  disguise.” “but dis iz marvellous. it might bees hims portrait.” “yes, it iz an interestin instance ov  throwback, which appearz 2 bees both fysical an spiritual. a study ov family portraits iz enough 2 convert  man 2 teh doctrine ov reincarnation. the fellow iz  baskerville—that iz evident.” “with designz upon teh succession.” “exactly. this chance ov teh picture has supplid us wif wan ov r most obvious missin links. we has him, watson, we has him, an i dare swear dat b4 2morrow night he will bees fluttering in r net as helpless as wan ov hims own butterflies. a pin,  cork, an  card, an we add him 2 teh baker street collection!” he burst into wan ov hims rare fitz ov laughter as he turnd away frum teh picture. i has not herd him laff often, an it has alwayz boded ill 2 somebody. i wuz up betimes in teh morning, but holmes wuz afoot earlir still, 4 i saw him as i dressed, comin up teh drive. “yes, we shud has  fol dai today,” he remarked, an he rubbed hims hanz wif teh joy ov action. “the nets r all in place, an teh drag iz bout 2 begin. we’ll knoe b4 teh dai iz out whethr we has caught r big, lean-jawed pike, or whethr he has got thru teh meshes.” “have u been on teh moor already?” “i has sent  report frum grimpen 2 princetown as 2 teh death ov selden. i finks i can promise dat none ov u will bees troubld in teh matter. and i has also speekd wif mah faithful cartwright, hoo wud certainly has pined away at teh door ov mah hut, as  dog doez at hims master’s grave, if i had not set hims mind at rest bout mah safety.” “what iz teh next move?” “to c sir henry. ah, her he is!” “good-morning, holmes,” sed teh baronet. “you look liek  general hoo iz plannin  battle wif hims chief ov teh staff.” “that iz teh exact situation. watson wuz askin 4 orders.” “and so doez i.” “very good. you r engaged, as i understand, 2 dine wif r frenz teh stapletons tonight.” “i hope dat u will come also. they r vary hospitable people, an i am sure dat they wud bees vary glad 2 c you.” “i fear dat watson an i must go 2 london.” “to london?” “yes, i finks dat we shud bees moar useful thar at teh present juncture.” the baronet’s face perceptibly lengthened. “i hopd dat u wuz goin 2 c me thru dis business. the hall an teh moor r not vary pleasant placez when wan iz alone.” “my dear fellow, u must trust me implicitly an doez egsaktly wut i tell you. you can tell ur frenz dat we shud has been happeh 2 has come wif you, but dat urgent busines requird us 2 bees in town. we hope vary soon 2 return 2 devonshire. will u remembr 2 giv them dat message?” “if u insist upon it.” “there iz no alternative, i assure you.” i saw by teh baronet’s clouded brow dat he wuz deeply hurt by wut he regarded as r desertion. “when doez u desire 2 go?” he askd coldly. “immediately aftr breakfast. we will driv in 2 coombe tracey, but watson will leef hims tings as  pledge dat he will come bak 2 you. watson, u will send  note 2 stapleton 2 tell him dat u regret dat u cannot come.” “i has  gud mind 2 go 2 london wif you,” sed teh baronet. “why shud i stay her alone?” “because it iz ur post ov duty. because u gaev me ur werd dat u wud doez as u wuz told, an i tell u 2 stay.” “all right, then, i’ll stay.” “one moar direction! i wish u 2 driv 2 merripit house. send bak ur trap, however, an let them knoe dat u intend 2 walk home.” “to walk acros teh moor?” “yes.” “but dat iz teh vary ting which u has so often cautioned me not 2 do.” “this tiem u cud doez it wif safety. if i had not evry confidence in ur nerve an courage i wud not suggest it, but it iz essenshul dat u shud doez it.” “then i will doez it.” “and as u value ur life doez not go acros teh moor in any direcshun save along teh straight path which leads frum merripit house 2 teh grimpen road, an iz ur natural wai home.” “i will doez jus wut u say.” “very good. i shud bees glad 2 git away as soon aftr breakfast as possible, so as 2 reach london in teh afternoon.” i wuz mutch astounded by dis programme, though i remembered dat holmes had sed 2 stapleton on teh night b4 dat hims visit wud terminate next day. it had not crossd mah mind however, dat he wud wish me 2 go wif him, nor cud i understand how we cud both bees absent at  moment which he him declared 2 bees critical. there wuz nothin 4 it, however, but implicit obedience; so we bade good-bye 2 r rueful friend, an  couple ov hourz afterwards we wuz at teh stashun ov coombe tracey an had dispatched teh trap upon itz return journey. a small boi wuz waitin upon teh platform. “any orders, sir?” “you will taek dis train 2 town, cartwright. the moment u arrive u will send  wire 2 sir henry baskerville, in mah name, 2 sai dat if he finds teh pocketbook which i has droppd he iz 2 send it by registered post 2 baker street.” “yes, sir.” “and ask at teh stashun office if thar iz  mesage 4 me.” the boi returned wif  telegram, which holmes handd 2 me. it ran: wire received. coming down wif unsigned warrant. arrive five-forty. lestrade. “that iz in anzwr 2 mine ov dis morning. he iz teh best ov teh professionals, i think, an we cud ned hims assistance. now, watson, i finks dat we cannot employ r tiem bettr than by callin upon ur acquaintance, mrs. laura lyons.” his plan ov campaign wuz beginnin 2 bees evident. he wud use teh baronet in ordr 2 convince teh stapletons dat we wuz rly gone, while we shud akshully return at teh instant when we wuz likely 2 bees needed. that telegram frum london, if menshund by sir henry 2 teh stapletons, must remove teh last suspicions frum der minds. already i seemd 2 c r nets drawing closer around dat lean-jawed pike. mrs. laura lyons wuz in her office, an sherlock holmes opened hims interview wif  frankness an directness which considerably amazed her. “i am investigatin teh circumstances which attended teh death ov teh late sir charles baskerville,” sed he. “my frend here, dr. watson, has informd me ov wut u has communicated, an also ov wut u has withheld in connecshun wif dat matter.” “what has i withheld?” she askd defiantly. “you has confessed dat u askd sir charles 2 bees at teh gate at ten o’clock. we knoe dat dat wuz teh place an hour ov hims death. you has withheld wut teh connecshun iz tween thees events.” “there iz no connection.” “in dat case teh coincidence must inded bees an extraordinary one. but i finks dat we shall succed in establishin  connection, aftr all. i wish 2 bees perfectly frank wif you, mrs. lyons. we regard dis case as wan ov murder, an teh evidence cud implicate not only ur frend mr. stapleton but hims wife as well.” the lady sprang frum her chair. “his wife!” she cried. “the fact iz no longr  secret. the person hoo has passed 4 hims sister iz rly hims wife.” mrs. lyons had resumed her seat. her hanz wuz grasping teh arms ov her chair, an i saw dat teh pink nails had turnd white wif teh pressure ov her grip. “his wife!” she sed again. “his wife! he iz not  married man.” sherlock holmes shrugged hims shoulders. “prove it 2 me! prove it 2 me! and if u can doez so—!” the fierce flash ov her eyes sed moar than any words. “i has come prepared 2 doez so,” sed holmes, drawing several papers frum hims pocket. “here iz  fotograf ov teh couple taken in york 4 yeers ago. it iz indorsed ‘mr. an mrs. vandeleur,’ but u will has no difficulty in recognizing him, an her also, if u knoe her by sight. here r 3 writteh descripshuns by trustworthy witnesses ov mr. an mrs. vandeleur, hoo at dat tiem kept st. oliver’s private school. read them an c if u can doubt teh identity ov thees people.” she glanced at them, an then lookd up at us wif teh set, rigid face ov  desperate woman. “mr. holmes,” she said, “this man had offrd me marriage on condishun dat i cud git  divorce frum mah husband. he has lied 2 me, teh villain, in evry conceivable way. not wan werd ov truth has he evr told me. and why—why? i imagined dat all wuz 4 mah own sake. but nao i c dat i wuz nevr anythin but  tool in hims hands. why shud i preserve faith wif him hoo nevr kept any wif me? why shud i try 2 shield him frum teh consequences ov hims own wicked acts? ask me wut u like, an thar iz nothin which i shall hold back. one ting i swear 2 you, an dat iz dat when i wrote teh lettr i nevr dreamed ov any harm 2 teh old gentleman, hoo had been mah kindest friend.” “i entirely bleev you, madam,” sed sherlock holmes. “the recital ov thees eventz must bees vary painful 2 you, an perhapz it will mak it easir if i tell u wut occurred, an u can check me if i mak any material mistake. the sendin ov dis lettr wuz suggestd 2 u by stapleton?” “he dictated it.” “i presume dat teh reason he gaev wuz dat u wud receive halp frum sir charles 4 teh legal expenses connectd wif ur divorce?” “exactly.” “and then aftr u had sent teh lettr he dissuaded u frum keepin teh appointment?” “he told me dat it wud hurt hims self-respect dat any othr man shud find teh money 4 such an object, an dat though he wuz  poor man him he wud devote hims last penny 2 removing teh obstacles which divided us.” “he appearz 2 bees  vary consistent character. and then u herd nothin til u read teh reportz ov teh death in teh paper?” “no.” “and he made u swear 2 sai nothin bout ur appointment wif sir charles?” “he did. he sed dat teh death wuz  vary mysterious one, an dat i shud certainly bees suspected if teh facts came out. he frightened me into remainin silent.” “quite so. but u had ur suspicions?” she hesitated an lookd down. “i knew him,” she said. “but if he had kept faith wif me i shud alwayz has dun so wif him.” “i finks dat on teh whole u has had  fortunate escape,” sed sherlock holmes. “you has had him in ur powr an he knew it, an yet u r alive. you has been walking 4 sum monthz vary near 2 teh edge ov  precipice. we must wish u good-morning now, mrs. lyons, an it iz probable dat u will vary shortly hear frum us again.” “our case becomez rounded off, an difficulty aftr difficulty thins away in frunt ov us,” sed holmes as we stood waitin 4 teh arrival ov teh expres frum town. “i shall soon bees in teh posishun ov bein able 2 put into  single connectd narrative wan ov teh most singular an sensational crimes ov modern times. students ov criminology will remembr teh analogous incidents in godno, in little russia, in teh yer ’66, an ov course thar r teh anderson murders in north carolina, but dis case possesses sum featurez which r entirely itz own. even nao we has no clear case against dis vary wily man. but i shall bees vary mutch surprisd if it iz not clear enough b4 we go 2 bed dis night.” the london expres came roaring into teh station, an  small, wiry bulldog ov  man had sprung frum  first-class carriage. we all 3 shook hands, an i saw at once frum teh reverenshul wai in which lestrade gazed at mah companion dat he had learnd  gud deal since teh dais when they had furst werkd together. i cud well remembr teh scorn which teh theories ov teh reasoner usd then 2 excite in teh practical man. “anything good?” he asked. “the biggest ting 4 years,” sed holmes. “we has 2 hourz b4 we ned finks ov starting. i finks we might employ it in gettin sum dinnr an then, lestrade, we will taek teh london fog out ov ur throat by givin u  breath ov teh pure night air ov dartmoor. never been there? ah, well, i don’t suppose u will forget ur furst visit.” chapter 14. the hound ov teh baskervilles one ov sherlock holmes’s defects—if, indeed, wan cud call it  defect—was dat he wuz exceedingly loath 2 communicate hims fol planz 2 any othr person til teh instant ov der fulfilment. partly it came no doubt frum hims own masterful nature, which lovd 2 dominate an surprise dose hoo wuz around him. partly also frum hims profeshunal caution, which urged him nevr 2 taek any chances. the result, however, wuz vary tryin 4 dose hoo wuz acting as hims agents an assistants. i had often suffered undr it, but nevr moar so than durin dat long driv in teh darkness. the great ordeal wuz in frunt ov us; at last we wuz bout 2 mak r final effort, an yet holmes had sed nothing, an i cud only surmise wut hims course ov akshun wud be. my nerves thrilled wif anticipashun when at last teh cold wind upon r facez an teh dark, void spacez on eithr side ov teh narrow road told me dat we wuz bak upon teh moor once again. every stride ov teh horses an evry turn ov teh wheels wuz takin us nearer 2 r supreme adventure. our conversashun wuz hampered by teh presence ov teh driver ov teh hird wagonette, so dat we wuz forcd 2 talk ov trivial matters when r nerves wuz tense wif emotion an anticipation. it wuz  relief 2 me, aftr dat unnatural restraint, when we at last passed frankland’s houz an knew dat we wuz drawing near 2 teh hall an 2 teh scene ov action. we did not driv up 2 teh door but got down near teh gate ov teh avenue. the wagonette wuz paid off an orderd 2 return 2 coombe tracey forthwith, while we startd 2 walk 2 merripit house. “are u armed, lestrade?” the lil detective smiled. “as long as i has mah trousers i has  hip-pocket, an as long as i has mah hip-pocket i has somethin in it.” “good! my frend an i r also ready 4 emergencies.” “you’re mighty close bout dis affair, mr. holmes. what’s teh game now?” “a waitin game.” “my word, it doez not seem  vary cheerful place,” sed teh detective wif  shiver, glancing round him at teh gloomy slopes ov teh hill an at teh huge lake ov fog which lay ovar teh grimpen mire. “i c teh lights ov  houz ahead ov us.” “that iz merripit house an teh end ov r journey. i must request u 2 walk on tiptoe an not 2 talk above  whisper.” we movd cautiously along teh track as if we wuz bound 4 teh house, but holmes halted us when we wuz bout 2 hundrd yardz frum it. “this will do,” sed he. “these rocks upon teh rite mak an admirable screen.” “we r 2 wait here?” “yes, we shall mak r lil ambush here. get into dis hollow, lestrade. you has been inside teh house, has u not, watson? can u tell teh posishun ov teh rooms? what r dose latticed windowz at dis end?” “i finks they r teh kitchen windows.” “and teh wan beyond, which shines so brightly?” “that iz certainly teh dining-room.” “the blinds r up. you knoe teh lie ov teh land best. creep forward quietly an c wut they r doing—but 4 heaven’s sake don’t let them knoe dat they r watched!” i tiptoed down teh path an stooped behind teh low wall which surrounded teh stunted orchard. creeping in itz shadow i reachd  point whence i cud look straight thru teh uncurtained window. there wuz only 2 men in teh room, sir henry an stapleton. they sat wif der profiles towardz me on eithr side ov teh round table. both ov them wuz smoking cigars, an coffee an wine wuz in frunt ov them. stapleton wuz talkin wif animation, but teh baronet lookd pale an distrait. perhaps teh thot ov dat lonely walk acros teh ill-omened moor wuz weighing heavily upon hims mind. as i watched them stapleton rose an left teh room, while sir henry filled hims glass again an leaned bak in hims chair, puffing at hims cigar. i herd teh creak ov  door an teh crisp sound ov boots upon gravel. the stepz passed along teh path on teh othr side ov teh wall undr which i crouched. looking over, i saw teh naturalist pause at teh door ov an out-house in teh corner ov teh orchard. a key turnd in  lock, an as he passed in thar wuz  curious scuffling noise frum within. he wuz only  minute or so inside, an then i herd teh key turn once moar an he passed me an reentered teh house. i saw him rejoin hims guest, an i crept quietly bak 2 wer mah companions wuz waitin 2 tell them wut i had seen. “you say, watson, dat teh lady iz not there?” holmes askd when i had finishd mah report. “no.” “where can she be, then, since thar iz no light in any othr room except teh kitchen?” “i cannot finks wer she is.” i has sed dat ovar teh great grimpen mire thar hung  dense, white fog. it wuz drifting slowly in r direcshun an banked itself up liek  wall on dat side ov us, low but thick an well defined. the moon shone on it, an it lookd liek  great shimmering ice-field, wif teh headz ov teh distant tors as rocks borne upon itz surface. holmes’s face wuz turnd towardz it, an he muttered impatiently as he watched itz sluggish drift. “it’s movin towardz us, watson.” “is dat serious?” “very serious, indeed—the wan ting upon earth which cud has disarranged mah plans. he can’t bees vary long, now. it iz already ten o’clock. our succes an even hims life cud depend upon hims comin out b4 teh fog iz ovar teh path.” the night wuz clear an fine above us. the starz shone cold an bright, while  half-moon bathed teh whole scene in  soft, uncertain light. before us lay teh dark bulk ov teh house, itz serrated roof an bristling chimneys hard outlined against teh silver-spangled sky. broad bars ov golden light frum teh lower windowz stretched acros teh orchard an teh moor. one ov them wuz suddenly shut off. the servants had left teh kitchen. there only remained teh lamp in teh dining-room wer teh 2 men, teh murderous host an teh unconscious guest, still chatted ovar der cigars. every minute dat white woolly plain which covered one-half ov teh moor wuz drifting closer an closer 2 teh house. already teh furst thin wisps ov it wuz curling acros teh golden square ov teh lighted window. the farther wall ov teh orchard wuz already invisible, an teh trees wuz standing out ov  swirl ov white vapour. as we watched it teh fog-wreaths came crawling round both corners ov teh houz an rolled slowly into wan dense bank on which teh uppr floor an teh roof floated liek  strange ship upon  shadowy sea. holmes struck hims hand passionately upon teh rock in frunt ov us an stamped hims feet in hims impatience. “if he isn’t out in  quartr ov an hour teh path will bees covered. in haf an hour we won’t bees able 2 c r hanz in frunt ov us.” “shall we moov farther bak upon highr ground?” “yes, i finks it wud bees as well.” so as teh fog-bank flowed onward we fell bak b4 it til we wuz haf  mile frum teh house, an still dat dense white sea, wif teh moon silvering itz uppr edge, swept slowly an inexorably on. “we r goin 2 far,” sed holmes. “we dare not taek teh chance ov hims bein overtaken b4 he can reach us. at all costz we must hold r ground wer we are.” he droppd on hims knees an clapped hims ear 2 teh ground. “thank god, i finks dat i hear him coming.” a sound ov quick stepz broke teh silence ov teh moor. crouching among teh stones we stared intently at teh silver-tipped bank in frunt ov us. the stepz grew louder, an thru teh fog, as thru  curtain, thar steppd teh man whom we wuz awaiting. he lookd round him in surprise as he emerged into teh clear, starlit night. then he came swiftly along teh path, passed close 2 wer we lay, an went on up teh long slope behind us. as he walked he glanced continually ovar eithr shoulder, liek  man hoo iz ill at ease. “hist!” cried holmes, an i herd teh sharp click ov  cocking pistol. “look out! it’s coming!” there wuz  thin, crisp, continuous patter frum somewhere in teh heart ov dat crawling bank. the cloud wuz within fifty yardz ov wer we lay, an we glared at it, all three, uncertain wut horror wuz bout 2 break frum teh heart ov it. i wuz at holmes’s elbow, an i glanced 4 an instant at hims face. it wuz pale an exultant, hims eyes shining brightly in teh moonlight. but suddenly they startd forward in  rigid, fixd stare, an hims lips parted in amazement. at teh same instant lestrade gaev  yell ov terror an threw him face downward upon teh ground. i sprang 2 mah feet, mah inert hand grasping mah pistol, mah mind paralyzed by teh dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us frum teh shadows ov teh fog. a hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such  hound as mortal eyes has evr seen. fire burst frum itz open mouth, itz eyes glowed wif  smouldering glare, itz muzzle an hackles an dewlap wuz outlined in flickering flame. never in teh delirious dream ov  disordered brain cud anythin moar savage, moar appalling, moar hellish bees conceived than dat dark form an savage face which broke upon us out ov teh wall ov fog. with long bounds teh huge black creature wuz leaping down teh track, followin hard upon teh footsteps ov r friend. so paralyzed wuz we by teh apparition dat we allowd him 2 pas b4 we had recovered r nerve. then holmes an i both fird together, an teh creature gaev  hideous howl, which showd dat wan at least had hit him. he did not pause, however, but bounded onward. far away on teh path we saw sir henry lukingz back, hims face white in teh moonlight, hims hanz raisd in horror, glaring helplessly at teh frightful ting which wuz hunting him down. but dat cry ov pain frum teh hound had blown all r fears 2 teh winds. if he wuz vulnerable he wuz mortal, an if we cud wound him we cud kill him. never has i seen  man run as holmes ran dat night. i am reckoned fleet ov foot, but he outpaced me as mutch as i outpaced teh lil professional. in frunt ov us as we flew up teh track we herd scream aftr scream frum sir henry an teh deep roar ov teh hound. i wuz in tiem 2 c teh beast spring upon itz victim, hurl him 2 teh ground, an worry at hims throat. but teh next instant holmes had emptied five barrels ov hims revolver into teh creature’s flank. with  last howl ov agony an  vicious snap in teh air, it rolled upon itz back, 4 feet pawing furiously, an then fell limp upon itz side. i stooped, panting, an pressed mah pistol 2 teh dreadful, shimmering head, but it wuz useles 2 pres teh trigger. the hooj hound wuz dead. sir henry lay insensible wer he had fallen. we tore away hims collar, an holmes breathed  prayer ov gratitude when we saw dat thar wuz no sign ov  wound an dat teh rescue had been in time. already r friend’s eyelids shivered an he made  feeble effort 2 move. lestrade thrust hims brandy-flask tween teh baronet’s teeth, an 2 frightened eyes wuz lukingz up at us. “my god!” he whispered. “what wuz it? what, in heaven’s name, wuz it?” “it’s dead, whatevr it is,” sed holmes. “we’ve laid teh family ghost once an forever.” in mere size an strength it wuz  terrible creature which wuz lyin stretched b4 us. it wuz not  pure bloodhound an it wuz not  pure mastiff; but it appeard 2 bees  combinashun ov teh two—gaunt, savage, an as large as  small lioness. even nao in teh stillness ov death, teh huge jawz seemd 2 bees dripping wif  bluish flame an teh small, deep-set, cruel eyes wuz ringed wif fire. i placed mah hand upon teh glowing muzzle, an as i held them up mah own fingerz smouldered an gleamed in teh darkness. “phosphorus,” i said. “a cunning preparashun ov it,” sed holmes, sniffing at teh ded animal. “there iz no smell which might has interfered wif hims powr ov scent. we owe u  deep apology, sir henry, 4 havin exposed u 2 dis fright. i wuz prepared 4  hound, but not 4 such  creature as this. and teh fog gaev us lil tiem 2 receive him.” “you has saved mah life.” “having furst endangered it. are u strong enough 2 stand?” “give me anothr mouthful ov dat brandy an i shall bees ready 4 anything. so! now, if u will halp me up. what doez u propose 2 do?” “to leef u here. you r not fit 4 furthr adventures tonight. if u will wait, wan or othr ov us will go bak wif u 2 teh hall.” he trid 2 stagger 2 hims feet; but he wuz still ghastly pale an trembling in evry limb. we helpd him 2  rock, wer he sat shivering wif hims face buried in hims hands. “we must leef u now,” sed holmes. “the rest ov r werk must bees done, an evry moment iz ov importance. we has r case, an nao we only wants r man. “it’s  thousand 2 wan against r findin him at teh house,” he continud as we retraced r stepz swiftly down teh path. “those shots must has told him dat teh game wuz up.” “we wuz sum distance off, an dis fog cud has deadened them.” “he followed teh hound 2 call him off—of dat u cud bees certain. no, no, he’s gone by dis time! but we’ll search teh houz an mak sure.” the frunt door wuz open, so we rushed in an hurried frum room 2 room 2 teh amazement ov  doddering old manservant, hoo met us in teh passage. there wuz no light save in teh dining-room, but holmes caught up teh lamp an left no corner ov teh houz unexplored. no sign cud we c ov teh man whom we wuz chasing. on teh uppr floor, however, wan ov teh bedroom doorz wuz locked. “there’s someone in here,” cried lestrade. “i can hear  movement. open dis door!” a faint moaning an rustling came frum within. holmes struck teh door jus ovar teh lock wif teh flat ov hims foot an it flew open. pistol in hand, we all 3 rushed into teh room. but thar wuz no sign within it ov dat desperate an defiant villain whom we expectd 2 see. instead we wuz faced by an object so strange an so unexpectd dat we stood 4  moment staring at it in amazement. the room had been fashioned into  small museum, an teh walls wuz lind by  numbr ov glass-topped cases fol ov dat collecshun ov butterflies an moths teh formation ov which had been teh relaxation ov dis complex an dangerous man. in teh centre ov dis room thar wuz an upright beam, which had been placed at sum period as  support 4 teh old worm-eaten baulk ov timber which spanned teh roof. to dis post  figure wuz tied, so swathed an muffled in teh sheets which had been usd 2 secure it dat wan cud not 4 teh moment tell whethr it wuz dat ov  man or  woman. one towel passed round teh throat an wuz secured at teh bak ov teh pillar. another covered teh lower part ov teh face, an ovar it 2 dark eyes—eyes fol ov grief an shame an  dreadful questioning—stared bak at us. in  minute we had torn off teh gag, unswathed teh bonds, an mrs. stapleton sank upon teh floor in frunt ov us. as her beautiful hed fell upon her chest i saw teh clear red weal ov  whiplash acros her neck. “the brute!” cried holmes. “here, lestrade, ur brandy-bottle! put her in teh chair! she has fainted frum ill-usage an exhaustion.” she opened her eyes again. “is he safe?” she asked. “has he escaped?” “he cannot escape us, madam.” “no, no, i did not mean mah husband. sir henry? is he safe?” “yes.” “and teh hound?” “it iz dead.” she gaev  long sigh ov satisfaction. “thank god! thank god! oh, dis villain! see how he has treatd me!” she shot her arms out frum her sleeves, an we saw wif horror dat they wuz all mottled wif bruises. “but dis iz nothing—nothing! it iz mah mind an soul dat he has tortured an defiled. i cud endure it all, ill-usage, solitude,  life ov deception, everything, as long as i cud still cling 2 teh hope dat i had hims love, but nao i knoe dat in dis also i has been hims dupe an hims tool.” she broke into passionate sobbing as she spoke. “you bear him no gud will, madam,” sed holmes. “tell us then wer we shall find him. if u has evr aided him in evil, halp us nao an so atone.” “there iz but wan place wer he can has fled,” she answered. “there iz an old tin mine on an island in teh heart ov teh mire. it wuz thar dat he kept hims hound an thar also he had made preparashuns so dat he might has  refuge. that iz wer he wud fly.” the fog-bank lay liek white wool against teh window. holmes held teh lamp towardz it. “see,” sed he. “no wan cud find hims wai into teh grimpen mire tonight.” she laughed an clapped her hands. her eyes an teeth gleamed wif fierce merriment. “he cud find hims wai in, but nevr out,” she cried. “how can he c teh guiding wands tonight? we planted them together, he an i, 2 mark teh pathway thru teh mire. oh, if i cud only has plucked them out today. then inded u wud has had him at ur mercy!” it wuz evident 2 us dat all pursuit wuz in vain til teh fog had lifted. meanwhile we left lestrade in posesshun ov teh houz while holmes an i went bak wif teh baronet 2 baskerville hall. the story ov teh stapletons cud no longr bees withheld frum him, but he took teh blow bravely when he learnd teh truth bout teh woman whom he had loved. but teh shock ov teh night’s adventures had shattered hims nerves, an b4 mornin he lay delirious in  high fevr undr teh care ov dr. mortimer. the 2 ov them wuz destind 2 travel togehtr round teh wurld b4 sir henry had become once moar teh hale, hearty man dat he had been b4 he became master ov dat ill-omened estate. and nao i come rapidly 2 teh conclushun ov dis singular narrative, in which i has trid 2 mak teh readr share dose dark fears an vague surmises which clouded r lives so long an endd in so tragic  manner. on teh mornin aftr teh death ov teh hound teh fog had lifted an we wuz guidd by mrs. stapleton 2 teh point wer they had findz  pathway thru teh bog. it helpd us 2 realise teh horror ov dis woman’s life when we saw teh eagerness an joy wif which she laid us on her husband’s track. we left her standing upon teh thin peninsula ov firm, peaty soil which tapered out into teh widespread bog. from teh end ov it  small wand planted her an thar showd wer teh path zigzagged frum tuft 2 tuft ov rushes among dose green-scummed pits an foul quagmires which barred teh wai 2 teh stranger. rank reeds an lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour ov decay an  heavy miasmatic vapour onto r faces, while  false step plunged us moar than once thigh-deep into teh dark, quivering mire, which shook 4 yardz in soft undulations around r feet. its tenacious grip plucked at r heelz as we walked, an when we sank into it it wuz as if sum malignant hand wuz tugging us down into dose obscene depths, so grim an purposeful wuz teh clutch in which it held us. once only we saw  trace dat someone had passed dat perilous wai b4 us. from amid  tuft ov cotton grass which bore it up out ov teh slime sum dark ting wuz projecting. holmes sank 2 hims waist as he steppd frum teh path 2 seize it, an had we not been thar 2 drag him out he cud nevr has set hims foot upon firm land again. he held an old black boot in teh air. “meyers, toronto,” wuz printd on teh leather inside. “it iz wurth  mud bath,” sed he. “it iz r frend sir henry’s missin boot.” “thrown thar by stapleton in hims flight.” “exactly. he retaind it in hims hand aftr usin it 2 set teh hound upon teh track. he fled when he knew teh game wuz up, still clutching it. and he hurled it away at dis point ov hims flight. we knoe at least dat he came so far in safety.” but moar than dat we wuz nevr destind 2 know, though thar wuz mutch which we might surmise. there wuz no chance ov findin footsteps in teh mire, 4 teh rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them, but as we at last reachd firmer ground beyond teh morass we all lookd eagerly 4 them. but no slightest sign ov them evr met r eyes. if teh earth told  true story, then stapleton nevr reachd dat island ov refuge towardz which he struggld thru teh fog upon dat last night. somewhere in teh heart ov teh great grimpen mire, down in teh foul slime ov teh huge morass which had sucked him in, dis cold an cruel-hearted man iz forever buried. many traces we findz ov him in teh bog-girt island wer he had hid hims savage ally. a huge driving-wheel an  shaft half-filled wif rubbish showd teh posishun ov an abandoned mine. beside it wuz teh crumblin remainz ov teh cottages ov teh miners, driven away no doubt by teh foul reek ov teh surroundin swamp. in wan ov thees  staple an chain wif  quantity ov gnawed bones showd wer teh animal had been confined. a skeleton wif  tangle ov brown hair adhering 2 it lay among teh _débris_. “a dog!” sed holmes. “by jove,  curly-haired spaniel. poor mortimer will nevr c hims pet again. well, i doez not knoe dat dis place containz any seekret which we has not already fathomed. he cud hide hims hound, but he cud not hush itz voice, an hence came dose cries which even in daylight wuz not pleasant 2 hear. on an emergency he cud keep teh hound in teh out-house at merripit, but it wuz alwayz  risk, an it wuz only on teh supreme day, which he regarded as teh end ov all hims efforts, dat he dared doez it. this paste in teh tin iz no doubt teh luminous mixture wif which teh creature wuz daubed. it wuz suggested, ov course, by teh story ov teh family hell-hound, an by teh desire 2 frighten old sir charles 2 death. no wondr teh poor devil ov  convict ran an screamed, even as r frend did, an as we ourselves might has done, when he saw such  creature bounding thru teh darkness ov teh moor upon hims track. it wuz  cunning device, for, apart frum teh chance ov drivin ur victim 2 hims death, wut peasant wud venture 2 inquire 2 closely into such  creature shud he git sight ov it, as lotz da has done, upon teh moor? i sed it in london, watson, an i sai it again now, dat nevr yet has we helpd 2 hunt down  moar dangerous man than he hoo iz lyin yonder”—he swept hims long arm towardz teh huge mottled expanse ov green-splotched bog which stretched away til it merged into teh russet slopes ov teh moor. chapter 15. a retrospection it wuz teh end ov november, an holmes an i sat, upon  raw an foggy night, on eithr side ov  blazing fire in r sitting-room in baker street. since teh tragic upshot ov r visit 2 devonshire he had been engaged in 2 affairs ov teh utmost importance, in teh furst ov which he had exposed teh atrocious conduct ov colonel upwood in connecshun wif teh famous card scandal ov teh nonpareil club, while in teh second he had defended teh unfortunate mme. montpensier frum teh charge ov murder which hung ovar her in connecshun wif teh death ov her step-daughter, mlle. carére, teh young lady who, as it will bees remembered, wuz findz 6 monthz latr alive an married in new york. my frend wuz in awsum spirits ovar teh succes which had attended  succession ov difficult an important cases, so dat i wuz able 2 induce him 2 discuss teh detailz ov teh baskerville mystery. i had waited patiently 4 teh opportunity 4 i wuz aware dat he wud nevr permit cases 2 overlap, an dat hims clear an logical mind wud not bees drawn frum itz present werk 2 dwell upon memories ov teh past. sir henry an dr. mortimer were, however, in london, on der wai 2 dat long voyage which had been recommendd 4 teh restorashun ov hims shattered nerves. they had calld upon us dat vary afternoon, so dat it wuz natural dat teh subject shud come up 4 discussion. “the whole course ov events,” sed holmes, “from teh point ov view ov teh man hoo calld him stapleton wuz simple an direct, although 2 us, hoo had no meanz in teh beginnin ov knowing teh motives ov hims akshuns an cud only learn part ov teh facts, it all appeard exceedingly complex. i has had teh advantage ov 2 conversations wif mrs. stapleton, an teh case has nao been so entirely cleared up dat i am not aware dat thar iz anythin which has remained  seekret 2 us. you will find  few notez upon teh mattr undr teh headin b in mah indexed list ov cases.” “perhaps u wud kindly giv me  sketch ov teh course ov eventz frum memory.” “certainly, though i cannot guarantee dat i carry all teh facts in mah mind. intense mental concentration has  curious wai ov blotting out wut has passed. the barrister hoo has hims case at hims fingers’ endz an iz able 2 argue wif an expert upon hims own subject finds dat  week or 2 ov teh courts will driv it all out ov hims hed once more. so each ov mah cases displaces teh last, an mlle. carére has blurred mah recollection ov baskerville hall. tomorrow sum othr lil problem cud bees submitted 2 mah notice which will in turn dispossess teh fair french lady an teh infamous upwood. so far as teh case ov teh hound goes, however, i will giv u teh course ov eventz as nearly as i can, an u will suggest anythin which i cud has forgotten. “my inquiries show beyond all queshun dat teh family portrait did not lie, an dat dis fellow wuz inded  baskerville. he wuz  son ov dat rodger baskerville, teh youngr brother ov sir charles, hoo fled wif  sinister reputation 2 south america, wer he wuz sed 2 has did unmarried. he did, as  mattr ov fact, marry, an had wan child, dis fellow, whose real naym iz teh same as hims father’s. he married beryl garcia, wan ov teh beauties ov costa rica, and, havin purloined  considerable sum ov public money, he changd hims naym 2 vandeleur an fled 2 england, wer he establishd  school in teh east ov yorkshire. his reason 4 attemptin dis speshul line ov busines wuz dat he had struck up an acquaintance wif  consumptive tutor upon teh voyage home, an dat he had usd dis man’s ability 2 mak teh undertakin  success. fraser, teh tutor, did however, an teh school which had begun well sank frum disrepute into infamy. the vandeleurs findz it convenient 2 change der naym 2 stapleton, an he brought teh remainz ov hims fortune, hims schemes 4 teh future, an hims taste 4 entomology 2 teh south ov england. i learnd at teh british museum dat he wuz  recognized authority upon teh subject, an dat teh naym ov vandeleur has been permanently attachd 2  certain moth which he had, in hims yorkshire days, been teh furst 2 describe. “we nao come 2 dat porshun ov hims life which has proved 2 bees ov such intense interest 2 us. the fellow had evidently made inquiry an findz dat only 2 lives intervened tween him an  valuable estate. when he went 2 devonshire hims planz were, i believe, exceedingly hazy, but dat he meant mischief frum teh furst iz evident frum teh wai in which he took hims wife wif him in teh character ov hims sister. the idea ov usin her as  decoy wuz clearly already in hims mind, though he cud not has been certain how teh detailz ov hims plot wuz 2 bees arranged. he meant in teh end 2 has teh estate, an he wuz ready 2 use any tool or run any risk 4 dat end. his furst act wuz 2 establish him as near 2 hims ancestral home as he could, an hims second wuz 2 cultivate  friendship wif sir charles baskerville an wif teh neighbours. “the baronet him told him bout teh family hound, an so prepared teh wai 4 hims own death. stapleton, as i will continue 2 call him, knew dat teh old man’s heart wuz weak an dat  shock wud kill him. so mutch he had learnd frum dr. mortimer. he had herd also dat sir charles wuz superstitious an had taken dis grim legend vary seriously. his ingenious mind instantly suggestd  wai by which teh baronet cud bees dun 2 death, an yet it wud bees hardly posible 2 brin home teh guilt 2 teh real murderer. “having conceived teh idea he proceeded 2 carry it out wif considerable finesse. an ordinary schemer wud has been content 2 werk wif  savage hound. the use ov artificial meanz 2 mak teh creature diabolical wuz  flash ov genius upon hims part. the dog he buyd in london frum ross an mangles, teh dealers in fulham road. it wuz teh strongest an most savage in der possession. he brought it down by teh north devon line an walked  great distance ovar teh moor so as 2 git it home without excitin any remarks. he had already on hims insect hunts learnd 2 penetrate teh grimpen mire, an so had findz  safe hiding-place 4 teh creature. here he kennelled it an waited hims chance. “but it wuz sum tiem coming. the old gentleman cud not bees decoyed outside ov hims groundz at night. several tiems stapleton lurked bout wif hims hound, but without avail. it wuz durin thees fruitless quests dat he, or rathr hims ally, wuz seen by peasants, an dat teh legend ov teh demon dog receivd  nu confirmation. he had hopd dat hims wife might lure sir charles 2 hims ruin, but her she proved unexpectedly independent. she wud not endeavour 2 entangle teh old gentleman in  sentimental attachment which might delivr him ovar 2 hims enemy. threats an even, i am sry 2 say, blowz refused 2 moov her. she wud has nothin 2 doez wif it, an 4  tiem stapleton wuz at  deadlock. “he findz  wai out ov hims difficulties thru teh chance dat sir charles, hoo had conceived  friendship 4 him, made him teh minister ov hims charity in teh case ov dis unfortunate woman, mrs. laura lyons. by representin him as  single man he acquird complete influence ovar her, an he gaev her 2 understand dat in teh event ov her obtainin  divorce frum her husband he wud marry her. his planz wuz suddenly brought 2  hed by hims knowledge dat sir charles wuz bout 2 leef teh hall on teh advice ov dr. mortimer, wif whose opinion he him pretended 2 coincide. he must act at once, or hims victim might git beyond hims power. he therefore put pressure upon mrs. lyons 2 rite dis letter, imploring teh old man 2 giv her an interview on teh evening b4 hims departure 4 london. he then, by  specious argument, preventd her frum going, an so had teh chance 4 which he had waited. “driving bak in teh evening frum coombe tracey he wuz in tiem 2 git hims hound, 2 treat it wif hims infernal paint, an 2 brin teh beast round 2 teh gate at which he had reason 2 expect dat he wud find teh old gentleman waiting. the dog, incited by itz master, sprang ovar teh wicket-gate an pursued teh unfortunate baronet, hoo fled screaming down teh yew alley. in dat gloomy tunnel it must inded has been  dreadful sight 2 c dat huge black creature, wif itz flaming jawz an blazing eyes, bounding aftr itz victim. he fell ded at teh end ov teh alley frum heart disease an terror. the hound had kept upon teh grassy border while teh baronet had run down teh path, so dat no track but teh man’s wuz visible. on seein him lyin still teh creature had probably approached 2 sniff at him, but findin him ded had turnd away again. it wuz then dat it left teh print which wuz akshully observed by dr. mortimer. the hound wuz calld off an hurried away 2 itz lair in teh grimpen mire, an  mystery wuz left which puzzled teh authorities, alarmed teh countryside, an finally brought teh case within teh scope ov r observation. “so mutch 4 teh death ov sir charles baskerville. you perceive teh devilish cunning ov it, 4 rly it wud bees almost impossible 2 mak  case against teh real murderer. his only accomplice wuz wan hoo cud nevr giv him away, an teh grotesque, inconceivable nachur ov teh device only servd 2 mak it moar effective. both ov teh women concerned in teh case, mrs. stapleton an mrs. laura lyons, wuz left wif  strong suspicion against stapleton. mrs. stapleton knew dat he had designz upon teh old man, an also ov teh existence ov teh hound. mrs. lyons knew neithr ov thees things, but had been impresd by teh death occurrin at teh tiem ov an uncancelled appointment which wuz only known 2 him. however, both ov them wuz undr hims influence, an he had nothin 2 fear frum them. the furst haf ov hims task wuz successfully accomplishd but teh moar difficult still remained. “it iz posible dat stapleton did not knoe ov teh existence ov an heir in canada. in any case he wud vary soon learn it frum hims frend dr. mortimer, an he wuz told by teh lattr all detailz bout teh arrival ov henry baskerville. stapleton’s furst idea wuz dat dis young stranger frum canada might possibly bees dun 2 death in london without comin down 2 devonshire at all. he distrusted hims wife evr since she had refused 2 halp him in laying  trap 4 teh old man, an he dared not leef her long out ov hims sight 4 fear he shud lose hims influence ovar her. it wuz 4 dis reason dat he took her 2 london wif him. they lodged, i find, at teh mexborough private hotel, in craven street, which wuz akshully wan ov dose calld upon by mah agent in search ov evidence. here he kept hims wife imprisoned in her room while he, disguised in  beard, followed dr. mortimer 2 baker street an afterwards 2 teh stashun an 2 teh northumberland hotel. his wife had sum inkling ov hims plans; but she had such  fear ov her husband—a fear founded upon brutal ill-treatment—that she dare not rite 2 warn teh man whom she knew 2 bees in danger. if teh lettr shud fall into stapleton’s hanz her own life wud not bees safe. eventually, as we know, she adopted teh expedient ov cuttin out teh werdz which wud form teh message, an addressing teh lettr in  disguised hand. it reachd teh baronet, an gaev him teh furst warning ov hims danger. “it wuz vary essenshul 4 stapleton 2 git sum article ov sir henry’s attire so that, in case he wuz driven 2 use teh dog, he might alwayz has teh meanz ov setting him upon hims track. with characteristic promptness an audacity he set bout dis at once, an we cannot doubt dat teh boots or chamber-maid ov teh hotel wuz well bribed 2 halp him in hims design. by chance, however, teh furst boot which wuz procured 4 him wuz  nu wan and, therefore, useles 4 hims purpose. he then had it returned an obtaind another—a most instructive incident, since it proved conclusively 2 mah mind dat we wuz dealing wif  real hound, as no othr supposition cud explain dis anxiety 2 obtain an old boot an dis indifference 2  nu one. the moar _outré_ an grotesque an incident iz teh moar carefully it deservez 2 bees examined, an teh vary point which appearz 2 complicate  case is, when duly considerd an scientifically handled, teh wan which iz most likely 2 elucidate it. “then we had teh visit frum r frenz next morning, shadowed alwayz by stapleton in teh cab. from hims knowledge ov r rooms an ov mah appearance, as well as frum hims general conduct, i am inclined 2 finks dat stapleton’s career ov crime has been by no meanz limitd 2 dis single baskerville affair. it iz suggestive dat durin teh last 3 yeers thar has been 4 considerable burglaries in teh west country, 4 none ov which wuz any criminal evr arrested. the last ov these, at folkestone court, in may, wuz remarkable 4 teh cold-blooded pistolling ov teh page, hoo surprisd teh masked an solitary burglar. i cannot doubt dat stapleton recruited hims waning resourcez in dis fashion, an dat 4 yeers he has been  desperate an dangerous man. “we had an example ov hims readiness ov resource dat mornin when he got away frum us so successfully, an also ov hims audacity in sendin bak mah own naym 2 me thru teh cabman. from dat moment he understood dat i had taken ovar teh case in london, an dat therefore thar wuz no chance 4 him there. he returned 2 dartmoor an awaited teh arrival ov teh baronet.” “one moment!” sed i. “you have, no doubt, describd teh sequence ov eventz correctly, but thar iz wan point which u has left unexplained. what became ov teh hound when itz master wuz in london?” “i has given sum attenshun 2 dis mattr an it iz undoubtedly ov importance. there can bees no queshun dat stapleton had  confidant, though it iz unlikely dat he evr placed him in hims powr by sharin all hims planz wif him. there wuz an old manservant at merripit house, whose naym wuz anthony. his connecshun wif teh stapletons can bees traced 4 several years, as far bak as teh school-mastering days, so dat he must has been aware dat hims master an mistress wuz rly husband an wife. this man has disappeared an has escaped frum teh country. it iz suggestive dat anthony iz not  common naym in england, while antonio iz so in all spanish or spanish-american countries. the man, liek mrs. stapleton herself, spoke gud english, but wif  curious lisping accent. i has myself seen dis old man cross teh grimpen mire by teh path which stapleton had marked out. it iz vary probable, therefore, dat in teh absence ov hims master it wuz he hoo cared 4 teh hound, though he cud nevr has known teh purpose 4 which teh beast wuz used. “the stapletons then went down 2 devonshire, whither they wuz soon followed by sir henry an you. one werd nao as 2 how i stood myself at dat time. it cud possibly recur 2 ur mems dat when i examined teh papr upon which teh printd werdz wuz fastened i made  close inspecshun 4 teh water-mark. in doin so i held it within  few inchez ov mah eyes, an wuz conscious ov  faint smell ov teh scent known as white jessamine. there r seventy-five perfumes, which it iz vary necessary dat  criminal expert shud bees able 2 distinguish frum each other, an cases has moar than once within mah own experience depended upon der prompt recognition. the scent suggestd teh presence ov  lady, an already mah thoughtz began 2 turn towardz teh stapletons. thus i had made certain ov teh hound, an had guessd at teh criminal b4 evr we went 2 teh west country. “it wuz mah game 2 watch stapleton. it wuz evident, however, dat i cud not doez dis if i wuz wif you, since he wud bees keenly on hims guard. i deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included, an i came down secretly when i wuz supposd 2 bees in london. my hardships wuz not so great as u imagined, though such trifling detailz must nevr interfere wif teh investigation ov  case. i stayed 4 teh most part at coombe tracey, an only usd teh hut upon teh moor when it wuz necessary 2 bees near teh scene ov action. cartwright had come down wif me, an in hims disguise as  country boi he wuz ov great assistance 2 me. i wuz dependent upon him 4 food an clean linen. when i wuz watchin stapleton, cartwright wuz frequently watchin you, so dat i wuz able 2 keep mah hand upon all teh strings. “i has already told u dat ur reportz reachd me rapidly, bein forwarded instantly frum baker street 2 coombe tracey. they wuz ov great survis 2 me, an especially dat wan incidentally truthful piece ov biography ov stapleton’s. i wuz able 2 establish teh identity ov teh man an teh woman an knew at last egsaktly how i stood. the case had been considerably complicatd thru teh incident ov teh escaped convict an teh relashuns tween him an teh barrymores. this also u cleared up in  vary effective way, though i had already come 2 teh same conclusions frum mah own observations. “by teh tiem dat u discoverd me upon teh moor i had  complete knowledge ov teh whole business, but i had not  case which cud go 2  jury. even stapleton’s attempt upon sir henry dat night which endd in teh death ov teh unfortunate convict did not halp us mutch in provin murder against r man. there seemd 2 bees no alternativ but 2 catch him red-handed, an 2 doez so we had 2 use sir henry, alone an apparently unprotected, as  bait. we did so, an at teh cost ov  severe shock 2 r client we succeeded in completing r case an drivin stapleton 2 hims destruction. that sir henry shud has been exposed 2 dis is, i must confess,  reproach 2 mah management ov teh case, but we had no meanz ov foreseeing teh terrible an paralyzing spectacle which teh beast presented, nor cud we predict teh fog which enabld him 2 burst upon us at such short notice. we succeeded in r object at  cost which both teh specialist an dr. mortimer assure me will bees  temporary one. a long journey cud enable r frend 2 recover not only frum hims shattered nerves but also frum hims wounded feelings. his luv 4 teh lady wuz deep an sincere, an 2 him teh saddest part ov all dis black busines wuz dat he shud has been deceived by her. “it only remainz 2 indicate teh part which she had playd throughout. there can bees no doubt dat stapleton exercised an influence ovar her which cud has been luv or cud has been fear, or vary possibly both, since they r by no meanz incompatible emotions. it was, at least, absolutely effective. at hims command she consented 2 pas as hims sister, though he findz teh limitz ov hims powr ovar her when he endeavoured 2 mak her teh direct accessory 2 murder. she wuz ready 2 warn sir henry so far as she cud without implicating her husband, an again an again she trid 2 doez so. stapleton him seemz 2 has been capable ov jealousy, an when he saw teh baronet paying court 2 teh lady, even though it wuz part ov hims own plan, still he cud not halp interrupting wif  passionate outburst which revealed teh fiery soul which hims self-contained manner so cleverly concealed. by encouragin teh intimacy he made it certain dat sir henry wud frequently come 2 merripit house an dat he wud sooner or latr git teh opportunity which he desired. on teh dai ov teh crisis, however, hims wife turnd suddenly against him. she had learnd somethin ov teh death ov teh convict, an she knew dat teh hound wuz bein kept in teh outhouse on teh evening dat sir henry wuz comin 2 dinner. she taxed her husband wif hims intendd crime, an  furious scene followed in which he showd her 4 teh furst tiem dat she had  rival in hims love. her fidelity turnd in an instant 2 bitter hatred, an he saw dat she wud betray him. he tied her up, therefore, dat she might has no chance ov warning sir henry, an he hoped, no doubt, dat when teh whole countryside put down teh baronet’s death 2 teh curse ov hims family, as they certainly wud do, he cud win hims wife bak 2 accept an accomplishd fact an 2 keep silent upon wut she knew. in dis i fancy dat in any case he made  miscalculation, an that, if we had not been there, hims doom wud none teh les has been sealed. a woman ov spanish blood doez not condone such an injury so lightly. and now, mah dear watson, without referrin 2 mah notes, i cannot giv u  moar detaild akownt ov dis curious case. i doez not knoe dat anythin essenshul has been left unexplained.” “he cud not hope 2 frighten sir henry 2 death as he had dun teh old uncle wif hims bogie hound.” “the beast wuz savage an half-starved. if itz appearance did not frighten itz victim 2 death, at least it wud paralyze teh resistance which might bees offered.” “no doubt. there only remainz wan difficulty. if stapleton came into teh succession, how cud he explain teh fact dat he, teh heir, had been livin unannounced undr anothr naym so close 2 teh property? how cud he claim it without causing suspicion an inquiry?” “it iz  formidable difficulty, an i fear dat u ask 2 mutch when u expect me 2 solve it. the past an teh present r within teh field ov mah inquiry, but wut  man cud doez in teh future iz  hard queshun 2 answer. mrs. stapleton has herd her husband discuss teh problem on several occasions. there wuz 3 posible courses. he might claim teh property frum south america, establish hims identity b4 teh british authoritiez thar an so obtain teh fortune without evr comin 2 england at all, or he might adopt an elaborate disguise durin teh short tiem dat he ned bees in london; or, again, he might furnish an accomplice wif teh proofs an papers, puttin him in as heir, an retaining  claim upon sum proportion ov hims income. we cannot doubt frum wut we knoe ov him dat he wud has findz sum wai out ov teh difficulty. and now, mah dear watson, we has had sum weekz ov severe work, an 4 wan evening, i think, we cud turn r thoughtz into moar pleasant channels. i has  box 4 _les huguenots_. have u herd teh de reszkes? might i trouble u then 2 bees ready in haf an hour, an we can stop at marcini’s 4  lil dinnr on teh way?” the end
